Troops defend your colonies against invasion by enemy empires. They can also be used as attacking forces to invade and take over enemy colonies.

[H3]Strength and Readiness[/H3]
Each race has its own unique infantry troop unit. This is the default troop unit that can be recruited at colonies without any special planetay facility. This infantry troop unit has a default defend strength.

The readiness of troops for combat is measured on a scale from 1 to 100. Troops at a readiness level of 100 are completely rested and ready for battle. When troops are in combat they suffer losses and their readiness drops. Readiness takes time to rise back to 100. Medical facilities can accelerate healing of troop readiness.

[H3]Recruitment[/H3]
Troops are recruited at your colonies. They cost money to maintain, so only recruit troops that you really need. However note that troop maintenance costs only apply to fully-trained troops. Troops that are being recruited do not have any maintenance costs.

It also takes time to recruit troops - they must be trained and equipped. The following factors influence troop recruitment time:
[ULI]Size of the colony - larger populations recruit troops faster[/ULI]
[ULI]Your empire’s government type - some government types recruit troops faster than others[/ULI]
[ULI]Troop Recruitment bonuses - some facilities or characters can provide troop recruitment rate bonuses[/ULI]

You must plan ahead to have adequate troops to support your aims.

To recruit new troops, select one of your colonies, then click the 'Manage Troops' button under the Selection Panel. This will open a set of buttons with all of the troops that can be recruited at the colony.

[H3]Garrisoning[/H3]
Troop units can be garrisoned at a colony. This ensures that they will not be picked up by troop transport ships, but instead will always remain at a colony to defend it.

When troops are garrisoned they appear with a blue line underneath their icon.

You can mark troops as garrisoned by selecting one of your colonies, then selecting a single troop unit in the Troops area. The buttons below the Selection Panel will change to match the selected troop. Click the 'Garrison troop' button to toggle its garrison status.

[H3]Troop Types[/H3]
There are five types of troops:
[ULI]Infantry: the basic defensive troop unit. Infantry are available from the start of the game. Each race has it's own unique infantry unit with various strengths and weaknesses[/ULI]
[ULI]Armored: the primary attack troop unit. Requires an Armor Barracks facility to recruit[/ULI]
[ULI]Planetary Defense: specialized defensive troop units that can intercept enemy troops as they travel from their landing ships to the planetary surface. Requires a Planetary Defense Center facility to recruit[/ULI]
[ULI]Special Forces: highly-trained infantry units that specialize in taking out colony defenses during an invasion (ground facilities, defending planetary defense units, enemy generals). Defending Special Forces focus on eliminating invading Special Forces units. Requires a Special Operations Barracks facility to recruit[/ULI]
[ULI]Titans: very strong high-end attack units. Requires a Titan Manufacturing Center facility to recruit[/ULI]

Each troop type has separate values for Attack and Defense. Thus some troop unit types are specialized at attack, and others at defense.

Some troop types are also larger than normal, and thus take more space on troop transport ships. Each troop type also has different maintenance costs, e.g. Armored troops are more expensive to maintain than Infantry.

Note that research is needed to recruit troop types other than Infantry. The Armored Barracks is needed to recruit Armored troops at a colony. The Special Operations Barracks is needed to recruit Special Forces troops at a colony. These facilities are unlocked through research.

In additions, the tech tree has a number of upgrades for each troop type, improving their attack or defend strength, Hover over each research project to see details of each upgrade.

[H3]Troop Loadouts for Ships and Fleets[/H3]
You can specify which types of troops should be loaded onto a fleet by selecting an Army Template for the fleet. Army Templates define the percentages of each troop type that should be used.

The troop transport ships in the fleet will attempt to load troops to match the percentages outlined in the Army Template.

Note that even though you can specify a preferred troop loadout for a ship or fleet, in practice other factors can alter which troops are actually picked up. There may not be sufficient ungarrisoned troops of the requested type available for pickup at your colonies.

When there are insufficient troops of a specified type to meet the preferred troop loadout, then the ship or fleet will attempt to substitute other troop types to completely fill the ship or fleet.

[H3]Balance and planning[/H3]
Be careful not to recruit too many troops - the maintenance costs can put a large drain on your funds.

Thus when you are at peace with your neighbors, minimize spending by keeping only the bare minimum of troops on your key colonies. When you decide to go on the offensive against another empire, recruit more troops.

[H3]Transporting your Troops[/H3]
Troops can be loaded onto ships that have troop storage components, such as troop transports or larger military ships. They can then be sent to another colony and unloaded there to reinforce it. Or they can be used as an invasion force at an enemy colony.

Fleets can be specialized as Invasion fleets, which are comprised of many troop transports. You can load troops onto a fleet using the 'Load Troops' mission type.
