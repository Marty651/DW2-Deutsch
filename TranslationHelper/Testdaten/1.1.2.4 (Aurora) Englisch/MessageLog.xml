    <Title>Strange Gravitic Fissures Encountered</Title>
    <Text>We have discovered strange localized gravitic fissures at Keyduxxe in the Bunadan system.

These gravitic energy fissures appear randomly around Keyduxxe. They slowly decay over time, but the entire area persists with these dangerous ruptures. The energy from them appears to be leaking through from another dimension. They can inflict heavy damage on ships without adequate armor and ion defenses.

What causes these fissures? Further research might reveal more information. Keyduxxe has large research bonuses, so we should build a research station here to unlock the mysteries behind this location.</Text>

    <Text>We have discovered a ruin on Reuhateth in the ancient Mortalen home system.
        
Careful study of the ruins has revealed information on two technologies. We can now work toward understanding the research projects 'Super Beams' and 'Planet Destroyer'.

These projects will give us the ability to construct a mighty Planet Destroyer.

We have found technology that has enabled research in [RESEARCH]Planet Destroyer[/RESEARCH].

We should hurry to research this project and exploit its benefits!

    <Title>Our Ancient Homeworld</Title>
    <Text>At long last, we have discovered Ackdara, our ancient homeworld. This was once a pristine ocean planet, but following the Cataclysm it became unrecognizable and uninhabitable. It was here that our ancestors first ventured forth across their oceans, seeking knowledge and perfection. It was here that our people created the most marvelous technology and brilliant architecture in the galaxy. Sadly, it was here that the history of our civilization was lost. 

And yet we have survived. We have ventured into the galaxy, sharing our perspectives and  offering improvement to those we encounter. Perhaps in this system we will discover more of that ancient wisdom, which we can then share for the betterment of other species.</Text>

Shakturi Psionic Virus makes a species more vulnerable to Shakturi psychic powers.\n\nAlthough not particularly deadly, it's lethality correlates with how resistant a species is to psychic attacks.\n\nInfected victims come under a form of psychic suggestion, making them behave in ways that maximize the spread of the virus. Thus Shakturi Psionic Virus is very infectious and can spread rapidly.</Text>

    <Title>Anicent Mortalen Homeworld</Title>
    <Text>We have discovered the ancient homeworld of the Mortalens. The world is destroyed, devastated by the ancient Cataclysm. 

Records recovered from the ruins reveal that the Mortalen Empire refused to side with either faction and instead made war against both the Shakturi Axis and the Freedom Alliance. If their records can be trusted, they fared remarkably well, winning battle after battle. Nevertheless, their victories came at a high price. The Mortalen lost so many troops that had they no choice but turn to cloning and synthetics, lest they be overwhelmed.

After a thorough exploration of the Mortalen homeworld, we have discovered
a fascinating relic, the ancient artifact called the Spear of the First King. This weapon, forged long ago and used by the warriors of this world. It is a meaningful symbol to the Mortalen, but it will be of use to us as well.

We have discovered an experimental planetary bombardment weapon.</Text>

We will fight, but we cannot defeat them on our own. We are proud, but without your help we are doomed.

Genetic Scrambling Syndrome attacks the genetic code in all of the cells of an infected creature, wiping out any useful biological instructions. This leads to very rapid disintegration of the infected creature, finally breaking them down to a puddle of protein slime. An outbreak of Genetic Scrambling Syndrome typically lasts only one month.

Were the ships damaged by the gravitic storm? Or did they meet their fate from some other source?

Although the ships are nearly destroyed, we could probably repair them if we sent a construction ship with sufficient armor and ion defense to protect it from the gravitic storm.

Maybe we can then unlock the mystery of their demise.</Text>

    <Title>Investigation Results</Title>
    <Text>Evidence obtained from the wreckage indicates that that as the Shakturi war dragged on, the Mortalen Empire could not meet the demand for ship personnel or troops. This location was dedicated to building almost entirely automated ships, despite the Mortalen dislike of robots, AI, and synthetics. 

Clearly this experiment was not successful. We have encountered evidence that some of the debris in orbit derives from battles between Mortalen ships, perhaps indicating that the automated vessels malfunctioned and attacked the Mortalen themselves. There is additional information that ship in orbit bombarded the planet surface. 

Data in some of the wreckage indicates the location of the Ancient Mortalen homeworld.

We have found technology that has advanced our understanding of [RESEARCH]Capital Ships[/RESEARCH].

We have found technology that has advanced our understanding of [RESEARCH]Robotic Troops[/RESEARCH].

We have found technology that has advanced our understanding of [RESEARCH]Basic Diplomacy: Mortalen Language and Expressions[/RESEARCH].

The Teekan are naturally slightly hostile towards us.

We can attempt to colonize them by sending a Colony Ship. Alternatively we can invade and take over the colony by landing troops.

Initial communications with the Teekans have been extremely successful. The Teekans regard us with some friendliness.

Research projects are available on our tech tree that can increase our understanding of the Teekan. We should research these projects to improve relations with the Teekan.</Text>

    <Text>The [FACTION]Tuydarea Confederation[/FACTION] have suffered a deadly outbreak of Genetic Scrambling Syndrome at their colony [LOCATION]Javen 2[/LOCATION] in the Javen system!

Genetic Scrambling Syndrome attacks the genetic code in all of the cells of an infected creature, wiping out any useful biological instructions. This leads to very rapid disintegration of the infected creature, finally breaking them down to a puddle of protein slime. An outbreak of Genetic Scrambling Syndrome typically lasts only one month. However it is highly infectious and thus can spread rapidly.</Text>

The messages indicate that this ship was part of an ancient Mortalen fleet. This fleet was tasked with attacking a fearsome adversary known as the Shakturi. Apparently the Shakturi won the battle...

In addition, we have found a set of galactic coordinates stored in the computer core. No explanation is given about these coordinates, but they appear to have been the next destination of the fleet...

We have added a location ping for the coordinates to the galactic map.

A datacore reveals some intriguing information: in the datacore are [DISCOVERY]NAVIGATIONAL DIRECTIONS[/DISCOVERY] pointing to [LOCATION]115599671,642652178[/LOCATION].

Maybe we should send a ship to investigate this location.</Text>

    <Title>Who are the Ketarov?</Title>
    <Text>Our analysts have learnt the following about the Ketarov:

Ketarovs are an average-sized bipedal mammalian race with short white fur.

Ketarovs are very intelligent and love intrigue and deception. Instead of engaging in open conflict with their enemies, they prefer to use espionage and sabotage to exploit their weaknesses.

They are often suspicious that others are working to undermine them. This natural paranoia reinforces their inclination towards spying and espionage. However it can also lead to misunderstandings, as they constantly question the intentions of even their friends.

For these reasons Ketarovs are often unreliable allies - ironically they are untrustworthy because they do not trust others.

Ketarovs are usually found in large communities dwelling on the open plains of Grasslands or Continental planets.</Text>

    <Text>We have encountered a new independent colony of Ketarovs at [FACTION]Bartuc[/FACTION] in the Tebru system.

The Ketarov are naturally hostile towards us.

We can invade and take over the colony by landing troops. Or we could attempt to colonize them by sending a Colony Ship, although this is unlikely to succeed due to their negative view of us.

Initial communications with the Ketarovs have been fairly neutral. The Ketarovs are wary of us.

Research projects are available on our tech tree that can increase our understanding of the Ketarov. We should research these projects to improve relations with the Ketarov.</Text>

    <Text>We have discovered new resources at [LOCATION]Rallteer 3[/LOCATION] in the Rallteer system.

Korabbian Spice is an extremely rare crystallized white spice. It is valued for its unique medicinal properties. Under special circumstances deposits of Korabbian spice will spontaneously accumulate on the walls of rocky canyons. The exact process that forms Korabbian spice has never been precisely identified. But it is theorized that the spice is created by a chemical reaction between certain types of rocks and the harsh, hot winds that sometimes gust through the canyons. It dramatically increases mental sharpness, allowing a being to perform incredible intellectual feats. Any colony supplied with Korabbian spice thus receives a large development bonus, over and above any other bonus. Once discovered, every effort should be made to control the trade of this highly valuable resource. Korabbian spice is found exclusively on Desert worlds.
Korabbian Spice provides the following bonuses: [BONUS]+22% Colony Development, +15% Colony Happiness, +5% All Research[/BONUS]</Text>

We can invade and take over the colony by landing troops. Or we could attempt to colonize them by sending a Colony Ship, although this is unlikely to succeed due to their negative view of us.

Initial communications with the Haakonishs have been extremely successful. The Haakonishs regard us with some friendliness.

    <Title>Who are the Securan?</Title>
    <Text>Our analysts have learnt the following about the Securan:

Securans are a strikingly attractive, green-skinned humanoid race.

They are friendly and are also very loyal allies.

Securans have a high reproduction rate, and thus their populations can grow quite rapidly.

They excel at performance art, especially singing and dancing. They are also expert musicians and composers.

Securans have a highly developed theater tradition. Their plays are packed with drama and suspense. Securan actors and actresses are in high demand all over the galaxy, filling leading roles in dramatic productions. Large Securan drama companies traverse the galaxy to perform in various locations.

They also take a passionate interest in cooking and eating. Enjoying good food and fine Securan wine is a central part of their culture.

Securans are very hospitable, and they will invariably indulge any off-world visitors in a grand feast that features all of their excellent cuisine.

Securans inhabit the vast open plains of Desert Savanna, Sandy Desert or Rocky Desert planets.</Text>

    <Title>Independent Colony of Securans encountered</Title>
    <Text>We have encountered a new independent colony of Securans at [FACTION]Horazon[/FACTION] in the Akuueni system.

The Securan are naturally mildly friendly towards us.

We can attempt to colonize them by sending a Colony Ship. Alternatively we can invade and take over the colony by landing troops.

Initial communications with the Securans have been extremely successful. The Securans regard us with some friendliness.

Research projects are available on our tech tree that can increase our understanding of the Securan. We should research these projects to improve relations with the Securan.</Text>

    <Title>Independent Colony of Humans encountered</Title>
    <Text>We have encountered a new independent colony of Humans at [FACTION]Ancient Slave Colony[/FACTION] in the Sol system.

The Human are naturally slightly hostile towards us.

We can attempt to colonize them by sending a Colony Ship. Alternatively we can invade and take over the colony by landing troops.

Initial communications with the Humans have gone very poorly. We accidentally insulted the Humans, causing great offense.

The Humans possess powerful artifacts:
Constitution Crystal (Solar Republic): A crystalline storage device containing possibly the only surviving original copy of the Constitution of the ancient Freedom Alliance.  As the first charter to fully unite mulitple alien species under one government, it is a unique and priceless part of the history of the galaxy.  This copy was said to be stored on the ancient Human homeworld of Terra.
The Glaive of Mor: An unusual weapon, Mortalen in style but Zenox in manufacture and made of an extremely advanced alloy.  It consists of multiple angled blades around a central disc and seems designed and balanced for throwing.  As with other ancient Mortalen weapons, it also contains a miniature generator within, which both energizes the blades and accelerates the disc to its target as well as then returning it expeditiously to its wielder, who wears a matching bracer which interlocks with this weapon.  Something else about the energy field around this weapon also seems to increase aggression at a remarkable range, even to most of the surface of planet.

Research projects are available on our tech tree that can increase our understanding of the Human. We should research these projects to improve relations with the Human.</Text>

Merturov Plague is the most deadly disease in the known galaxy. It swiftly eats the brain of the infected creature, progressively causing insanity, immobilization and eventual death.
