Empires have various forms of government, each with their own characteristics. Different types of government also naturally attract and repel other types, shaping diplomatic relations throughout the galaxy.

The five basic government types are: Democracy, Republic, Feudalism, Monarchy and Military Dictatorship. These government types are available to all empires and alien races.

Three other government types are available only to certain alien races: Mercantile Guild, Technocracy and Hive Mind. Two other special forms of government also exist: the Way of the Ancients and the Way of Darkness. These two ancient government types must be rediscovered before they are available to an empire.

Each alien race has natural tendencies towards certain forms of government: more aggressive races often prefer Military Dictatorships; more peaceful races usually prefer Democracy or Republics.

Each government type has a unique set of bonuses and penalties, making them more or less suitable for different styles of rulership. Each of these government types is explained in detail in their own topic. Refer to each of these individual topics for more details.

[H3]Natural Affinity[/H3]
Each type of government has natural friends and rivals in other specific government types. However government types are simply one of many factors that influence how empires interact with each other – empires with government types that are naturally rivals can still be friends because of other factors like trade.

On the other hand empires with government types that are naturally friends can still be enemies due to other factors like disputes over systems.
