Research unlocks new tech that you can use to improve your empire in various ways:
[ULI]new ship hulls and components allow you to build bigger and better ships and bases[/ULI]
[ULI]new planetary facilities help improve your colonies[/ULI]
[ULI]improve your ability to colonize new worlds[/ULI]
[ULI]improve your ground troops[/ULI]
[ULI]provide various bonuses, including improving your diplomatic relations with other factions[/ULI]

[H3]Research Screen[/H3]
In the Research Screen you can view the entire tech tree and select new projects to research.

You can also accelerate research progress by paying to 'crash-research' a project.

[H3]Concurrent Projects[/H3]
When you have multiple research stations you can research more than one project at a time.

You set the upper limit to how many projects to concurrently research using this value.

[H3]Sources and Output[/H3]
Research output comes from both the populations at your colonies and research stations that you build.

To fully exploit your research output you should also spend excess funding on research. Fully-funded research means faster access to new technologies.

You can allocate research funding in the Funding Levels screen (shift-F2) in the Empire section.
