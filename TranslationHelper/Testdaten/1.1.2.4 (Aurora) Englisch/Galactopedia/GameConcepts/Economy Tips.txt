Running out of money? Need more powerful military forces, but don’t have the cash to pay for them? Following the economic tips below can help you.

[H3]Establish new Colonies[/H3]
Continue to expand your empire with new colonies. This increases the number of tax-paying citizens.

It also stimulates demand for new freighters and mining ships from your private citizens. These ship purchases at your construction yards add more money to your state economy.

[H3]Improve your existing Colonies[/H3]
The growth rate of each of your colonies is strongly tied to the overall suitability of the planet for the population living there. So anything that improves suitability is important. This includes Colonization research.

Corruption can also reduce the income and happiness at your colonies. Building Planetary Administration facilities reduces corruption and increases happiness.

[H3]Defend your trade routes[/H3]
It is critical that you maintain unimpeded trade throughout your empire, allowing goods to flow freely.

This means defending all of the elements that make up your empire’s economic supply chain: colonies, spaceports, mining stations and even independent alien colonies that you trade with.

Freighters transport important resources between these locations. Disruption to these trade routes can severely hamper your economy.

So eliminate any pirates, aggressive space creatures or enemy ships that threaten these locations.

[H3]Maximize luxury resource access[/H3]
Try to obtain consistent access to as many luxury resources as possible. These help your colonies to develop and grow, providing greater tax revenue.

[H3]Minimize maintenance expenses[/H3]
Ships, bases, troops and planetary facilities all have ongoing maintenance costs.

So you should carefully plan your needs for any new ships or bases. 

Only recruit troops that you really need to defend key colonies. Build up more troops only when you plan on war.

[H3]Spaceports spread across your empire[/H3]
Building spaceports at strategic locations across your empire can accelerate growth at your colonies. Resources mined by your mining ships and mining stations can be transported to nearby spaceports faster, making them available for use in your empire, or for sale to other empires.

[H3]Select an appropriate Government[/H3]
Select a form of government that aligns with your goals. Some governments have lower maintenance costs. Others lower the amount of corruption.

[H3]Seek out Trade Agreements[/H3]
You gain income when you form Trade treaties with other empires. In this situation a small percentage of the entire trade volume between the two empires is earned as bonus income by each empire. Over time the bonus percentage grows until it reaches a maximum limit.
