This screen lists all of the potential new colonies you can target. Check the extensive sort and filter options at the top of the panel. The filter options allow you to target specific suitability levels, alien races or planet types.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the new colony locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the size and colonization suitability of the planet or moon. Hovering over the suitability rating provides a detailed summary of how suitable the new colony is for each race in your empire.

[H3]Colonizing Independent worlds[/H3]
If the potential new colony is already inhabited by an independent alien race (an independent colony) then the race and population level is shown, along with the current chance of successfully colonizing the independent colony, i.e. how likely they are to welcome joining your empire.

[H3]Queuing Colonization[/H3]
The button at the right allows you to queue colonization of the planet or moon. This will build a new colony ship, fill it with colonists from one of your colonies and then send the new colony ship to the target world to colonize it.

Alternatively, if a suitable colony ship already exists in your empire, this may instead be used to colonize the new world.

[H3]Dangerous Locations[/H3]
A red lightning bolt symbol will be shown next to the location name if the location is considered dangerous. A location is dangerous when there are uncleared threats present, like pirates or deadly space creatures.

Non-military ships will not travel to a dangerous location. The threats must first be cleared by military ships or a fleet. This means that while you can queue construction of new colony at a dangerous location, colony ships will not travel there until the threats are cleared.
