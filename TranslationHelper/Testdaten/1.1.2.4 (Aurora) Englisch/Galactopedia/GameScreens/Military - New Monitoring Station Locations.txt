This screen lists ideal locations where you should build new monitoring stations.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the new monitoring station locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

[H3]Queuing New Monitoring Stations[/H3]
The button at the right allows you to queue construction of a new monitoring station at the location. You can click the button again to cancel construction.

If you cannot build at the location the Queue button will be disabled. A tooltip on the button will explain why you cannot build there.
