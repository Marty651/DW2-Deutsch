Any spy characters in your empire are shown in this list.

You can see the details of each spy by hovering over the list entry and clicking to lock open the panel at the right.

You can change a spy's name by clicking on their name under the portrait and typing a new one.

[H3]Intelligence Missions[/H3]
Spies carry out intelligence missions against other factions, stealing maps and tech or sabotaging another faction in various ways.

They can also perform counter-intelligence, protecting your empire from enemy spy missions.

Each spy's skills strongly determine which types of missions they are best at.

[H3]Assigning Missions[/H3]
To assign a mission to a spy select the target empire, mission type, any specific mission target and the time to complete from the dropdown lists in the mission section, then click the 'Assign Mission' button.

As you select different options the mission success chance is shown at the right. Be careful not to assign missions that are too difficult. Otherwise your spy could be intercepted and even captured, leading to serious diplomatic repercussions.

If you want to completely automate which missions are assigned to a spy you can automate the spy using the 'Automate' button under the spy portrait at the right.

[H3]Events[/H3]
At the very bottom of the detail panel is a list of all the events that the spy has been involved with. Various events can improve or decrease their skills, or provide new character traits. Successfully completing intelligence missions can especially increase the skills of your spy.
