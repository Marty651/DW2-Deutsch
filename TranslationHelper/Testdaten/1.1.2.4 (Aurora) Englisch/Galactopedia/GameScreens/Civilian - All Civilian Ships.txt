This screen lists all of the civilian ships in your empire. This includes freighters, passenger ships and mining ships.

Civilian ships are part of your civilian economy, so you cannot normally assign missions to them. Instead they seek out their own missions: moving cargo, transporting tourists and migrants, and mining resources.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the civilian ships are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the ship's current mission. It also shows any cargo or passengers that the ship is carrying.
