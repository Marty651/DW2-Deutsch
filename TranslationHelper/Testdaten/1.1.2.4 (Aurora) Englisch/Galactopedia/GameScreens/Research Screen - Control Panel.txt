At the right of the screen is the research Control Panel. This panel provides a number of functions helpful for navigating the tech tree.

[H3]Exiting Research[/H3]
At the top is the Exit Research button. Click this button to close the Research screen and return to the game.

[H3]Maximum Concurrent Projects[/H3]
Below this is an explanation of the maximum number of concurrent research projects. Hover this explanation for further details.

[H3]Zoom In/Out[/H3]
At the right are the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons that allow you to see more or less of the available projects.

[H3]Jump Buttons[/H3]
Next are the Jump buttons. Clicking one of these buttons allows you to immediately move the view to the first row of projects for that category.

For example, clicking the 'Hyperspace Tech' jump button will immediately move the view to show hyperdrive projects at the top of the screen.

[H3]Filtering Projects[/H3]
Below this is a dropdown list that allows filtering the projects that are shown. This allows you to focus exclusively in one category. Of course it also means that you cannot see the other projects. So be sure to revert back to 'All Projects'.

[H3]Next Suggested Project[/H3]
Next is the 'Queue Suggested Project' button. This button suggests the next project that your research advisors think you should research. Click the button to queue the suggested project.

Hovering over the button will provide a summary of the suggested project. While hovering the button the project will also be 'pinged' in the view (you may need to zoom out to see where it is).

[H3]Research Queue[/H3]
Finally there is the research queue. This is all the projects that are currently queued for research. The top-most projects are currently being actively progressed (the number of concurrent projects), while the subsequent projects are waiting until the top projects are completed.

You can remove projects from the queue by right-clicking them in the queue. You can also move projects up or down the queue using the arrows at the right.
