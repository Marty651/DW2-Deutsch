The center of the screen shows a preview of the design.

You can rotate the view by holding down the right-mouse-button and moving the mouse left/right and up/down.

Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in or out of the preview.

[H3]External Bay Markers[/H3]
The external bays are shown on the preview by a spherical marker. The color of the marker matches the type of the bay.

You can toggle the external bay markers on or off using the button at the right of the tactical settings area.

You can place selected components directly into the external bays on the preview:
[OLI]select a component in the Available Components list[/OLI]
[OLI]the valid bays are then highlighted on the preview[/OLI]
[OLI]left-click on a valid bay where you want to add the component[/OLI]

You can also do the following:
[ULI]right-click a bay position in the preview to remove an existing component from the external bay[/ULI]

[H3]Engine Placement[/H3]
Note that when you add engines to a ship design, the actual bay where the engine is added may be different to the bay you selected. This is because engines must remain symmetrical, and thus will always be added on alternating sides of the design.
