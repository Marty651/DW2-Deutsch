Exploration involves sending out exploration ships to visit unknown worlds, revealing their resources, colonization suitability, and any special bonuses. They may also encounter ancient ruins or abandoned ships or bases that can be investigated.

At each location the exploration ship sends out survey teams to inspect the planet. Surveying is slow and time-consuming.

Higher tech levels unlock exploration scanner components that allow faster exploration. However slower survey teams can still be useful to explore a location more thoroughly and thus uncover deeply hidden items.

[H3]Exploration Ship List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the exploration ships in your empire. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the exploration ship locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

You change the automation status of the exploration ship using the button at the far-right of the list item.

[H3]Exploration Map Overlay[/H3]
When the Exploration Ships list is open, the exploration galaxy map overlay is auto-enabled, showing the exploration status for each system. Green systems are fully explored, while yellow systems are partially explored.
