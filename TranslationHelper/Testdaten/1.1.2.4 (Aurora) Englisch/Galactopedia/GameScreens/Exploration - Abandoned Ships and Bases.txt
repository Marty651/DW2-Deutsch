Exploration may occasionally reveal abandoned ships or bases. These may hold important information that you can obtain when you board and investigate. They can usually also be salvaged by sending a construction ship to repair them.

[H3]Abandoned Ships and Bases List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the known abandoned ships and bases that you have encountered while exploring the galaxy.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the abandoned ship or base locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select the abandoned ship or base. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

The button at the right allows you to queue repair and investigation of the abandoned ship or base. This will send a construction ship to repair the item.
