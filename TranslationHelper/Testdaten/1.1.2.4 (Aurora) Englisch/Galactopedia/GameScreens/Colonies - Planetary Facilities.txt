Planetary Facilities are built at colonies in your empire. They provide various bonuses or new capabilities for the colony.

Some facilities allow recruitment of new troop types. Others provide ground-based weapons to defend the colony. Other facilities give bonuses to governance, reducing corruption and improving happiness and thus increasing the income from the colony.

New facilities are enabled through research: examine the projects in the research screen to see what facilities you can unlock.

[H3]Building new Facilities[/H3]
To build a new facility at a colony, select the Colony and use the 'Build Facilities' action button under the Selection Panel. This will present a list of buttons with all of the facilities that can be built at the colony. Hover each button for a summary of the facility. Click a button to pay the construction cost and begin building the facility.

[H3]Facility List Items[/H3]
This screen lists all of the planetary facilities, wonders and ruins at colonies in your empire. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. The filter options allow you to focus on specific facility types, like weapon facilities, troop recruitment or governance buildings.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the facility locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Hovering a list item opens a detailed summary of the facility in a panel at the right.
