This screen lists colonies where you can build new spaceports. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the new spaceport locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

[H3]Queuing New Spaceports[/H3]
The button at the right allows you to queue construction of a new spaceport at the colony. You can click the button again to cancel construction.

If you cannot build at the location the Queue button will be disabled. A tooltip on the button will explain why you cannot build there.
