The Design Overview displays all of the current stats for your design. The values in this panel change as you add and remove components to the hull.

There are many sections to the Design Overview showing data on various aspects of the design. Much of the data has further information when hovered.

At the top is the design name. Click here to type a new name.

[H3]Recommendations[/H3]
Next is the Recommendations button. This shows a summary of any warnings or errors in the current design. 

Hover over the Recommendations button to popout a larger summary panel. Click the button to lock the recommendations panel open.

The design is not valid (and cannot be saved) until any errors are resolved.

[H3]Core Design Information[/H3]
Next is a summary of the key design data. This includes information about the purchase and maintenance costs.

It also outlines some important requirements:
[ULI]the design cannot be larger than the maximum size allowed by the hull[/ULI]
[ULI]there must be adequate crew for the design[/ULI]

[H3]Rating[/H3]
The Rating section summarizes data about the design in 4 key areas: Attack Strength, Defend Strength, Speed and Maneuvering, and Scanners.

Hover over each value for a breakdown of the factors that contribute to the rating in each area.

[H3]Energy[/H3]
The Energy section summarizes the energy generation, storage and distribution in the design.

It also shows graphs outlining how energy is consumed both at sublight speeds in combat and during hyperspace travel. For bases only one graph is shown.

An important value is the reactor energy generation rate per unit of fuel. This shows the efficiency of the reactor fuel usage, which has a direct impact on how quickly a ship needs to refuel.

[H3]Movement[/H3]
This section is only relevant to ships. It shows the movement speed and energy usage at various levels.

Also shown here is the hyperdrive jump range and overall fuel range.

The hyperdrive jump accuracy indicates the minimum jump exit range when travelling to a location without a colony or base of your own, e.g. when attacking an enemy location.

This means that the ship will exit the jump at approximately this range and then must travel at sub-light speed towards the destination.

[H3]Weapons[/H3]
The Weapons section outlines weapon ranges and damage rates per second across various weapon categories.

Hovering over the weapon damage graphs reveals further information.

Also shown are the fighter capacity and build rate.

[H3]Defense[/H3]
The Defense section shows the shield, armor and damage repair values for the design.

Hovering over the shield and armor graphs reveals further information.

Also shown are the boarding defense strength.

[H3]Targeting and Countermeasures[/H3]
This section shows the targeting and countermeasures bonuses.

Improved targeting makes weapons more accurate and more likely to strike their target.

Improved countermeasures makes a design more able to throw off enemy weapons and thus avoid damage.

[H3]Sensors[/H3]
The Sensors section outlines the strength and range of a variety of different scanner types:
[ULI]general short- and long-range scanners for detecting distant ships[/ULI]
[ULI]hyperjump tracking of enemy ships when they jump away from your location[/ULI]
[ULI]trace scanning of internal information about nearby enemy vessels[/ULI]
[ULI]scanner jamming that protects against scanning by enemies[/ULI]

[H3]Industry[/H3]
The Industry section has values for various industrial categories like cargo storage, docking bay throughput, mining, research and others.

[H3]Bonuses[/H3]
The Bonuses section summarizes any bonuses provided by the hull or any components in the design.

[H3]Resources Required to Build[/H3]
This section shows the total resources that are required to build a new copy of this design.

This includes resources from the hull and all components on the design.
