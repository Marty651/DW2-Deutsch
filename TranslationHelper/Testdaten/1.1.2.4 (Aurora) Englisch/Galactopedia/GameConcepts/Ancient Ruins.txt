As you explore the galaxy you may discover remnants of civilizations long past. These ruins are well worth investigating - they often contain useful information that can help your empire. If you are the first to encounter the ruins then your empire receives these benefits.

Ruins may also reveal secret knowledge, uncovering details about the galaxy’s history. At the very least they can point you in the right direction as you learn the truth about the past.

[H3]Bonuses from Ruins[/H3]
Ancient ruins also often provide bonuses, such as research or scenery bonuses.

Research bonuses can be obtained by building a Research Station at the planet. 

Ruins sometimes have scenery bonuses, and thus will attract tourism to any colony that has them. If ruins are at an uninhabited planet or moon, then you can build a resort base there to allow tourism to the ruins.

To obtain any other types of bonus you must colonize the planet, if that is possible with your current tech.

Finally, remember that you may choose not to investigate all ruins that you encounter. Rumour has it that some ruins conceal items that are better left undisturbed...
