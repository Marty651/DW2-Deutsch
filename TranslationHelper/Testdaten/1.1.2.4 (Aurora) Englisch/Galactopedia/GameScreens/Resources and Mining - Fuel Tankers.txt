Fuel Tankers travel around refuelling ships that are low on fuel. When you assign Fuel Tankers to a fleet they will give priority to refuelling ships in their fleet.

They can mine fuel from any location with a fuel resource. But they prefer to load fuel from a spaceport or colony, because this is usually a quicker way to obtain fuel.
