Your relationship with other empires can take a number of forms, beginning with no contact, and progressing all the way through to defense treaties and operations map sharing.

You can have any number of treaties at the same time. For example, you can have a Non Aggression treaty, Free Trade agreement and Migration treaty at the same time.

However when war is declared all current treaties are cancelled.

The different treaty types are listed below:

[H3]No relationship[/H3]
This means that there is no special relationship between the two empires.
 
[H3]Non Aggression[/H3]
The empires agree not to attack each others ships or bases.

[H3]Pirate Protection[/H3]
Pirate factions may offer Pirate Protection treaties to empires. This means that the empire pays the pirates a monthly fee to avoid being attacked by them.

[H3]Trade Agreements[/H3]
The empires agree to trade resources between each other. Without a trade agreement there is no resource trading at all between the two empires.

There are 3 levels of trade agreement:
[ULI]Restricted Trade: 50% trade fees[/ULI]
[ULI]Limited Trade: 20% trade fees[/ULI]
[ULI]Free Trade: no trade fees[/ULI]

[H3]Territory Map Sharing[/H3]
The two empires regularly swap territory maps, revealing the location of their colonized systems.

[H3]Migration[/H3]
The two empires agree to accept migrants between their colonies from each other.

Initiating a migration treaty requires the offerer to have an [WARN]ambassador assigned[/WARN] to the recipient's capital.

[H3]Exploration[/H3]
The two empires agree to allow exploration ships to operate freely within each others territory.

[H3]Mining Rights[/H3]
The two empires agree to allow the building on mining stations anywhere within each others territory.

Initiating mining rights requires the offerer to have an [WARN]ambassador assigned[/WARN] to the recipient's capital.

[H3]Galaxy Map Sharing[/H3]
The two empires regularly swap galaxy maps, revealing all of their exploration data.

[H3]Military Refuelling[/H3]
The two empires agree to allow their fleets and military ships to refuel at each others bases and colonies.

Initiating military refuelling requires the offerer to have an [WARN]ambassador assigned[/WARN] to the recipient's capital.

[H3]Research[/H3]
The two empires agree to share a portion of their research output.

This means that each empire gets 20% of the other empire's research output added to their own output when researching projects, enabling them to access new techs faster.

Initiating a research treaty requires the offerer to have an [WARN]ambassador assigned[/WARN] to the recipient's capital.

[H3]Intelligence Sharing[/H3]
The two empires agree to share intelligence data with each other. This means that the results of the following espionage missions are shared with the other empire:
[ULI]Stealing Territory Map[/ULI]
[ULI]Stealing Galaxy Map[/ULI]
[ULI]Stealing Operations Map[/ULI]

Initiating intelligence sharing requires the offerer to have an [WARN]ambassador assigned[/WARN] to the recipient's capital.

[H3]Defense[/H3]
The two empires agree to defend each other in the event that another empire declares war on either party.

Initiating a defense treaty requires the offerer to have an [WARN]ambassador assigned[/WARN] to the recipient's capital.

[H3]Operations Map Sharing[/H3]
The two empires agree to share the location of all their units throughout the galaxy. This provides better shared visibility of enemy units and allows better coordination.

Initiating operations map sharing requires the offerer to have an [WARN]ambassador assigned[/WARN] to the recipient's capital.

[H3]War[/H3]
Open warfare between two empires. Expect opportunistic attacks on outlying mining stations as well as coordinated attacks on your colonies along with ground invasions.

War continues until both sides agree to end it. Empires will typically agree to end a war when they are pressed with heavy losses. Alternatively an empireâ€™s populace may become weary of a long war and force an end to the fighting.

[H3]Subjugated Vassal[/H3]
When a war ends in a decisive victory the winner can demand that the loser become their subjugated vassal. Alternatively the loser can offer to become a vassal of the winner.

Subjugated vassals pay monthly tribute to their parent empire. They are also prohibited from engaging in their own independent diplomacy. Thus they cannot form treaties with any other faction.

When an empire becomes a vassal it also automatically includes the following treaty types: Non Aggression, Free Trade, Galaxy Map Sharing, Military Refuelling, Defense.

When a vassal undertakes risky actions that could lead to war (attacking another empire, intelligence missions against another empire) they anger their parent empire and their tribute payments may increase.

The only way for a vassal to free themselves from their parent is to declare war against their parent.
