This screen lists all of the artifacts owned by your empire.

Artifacts are objects that you can acquire through exploration. They typically provide bonuses to your empire or to their location. Sometimes artifacts must be at a colony or at your capital to provide their benefits.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the artifact locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Hovering over an artifact in the list will also show a detailed summary panel at the right.
