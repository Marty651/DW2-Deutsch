    <Name>Scroll of Generations</Name>
    <Description>The Scroll of Generations is a lengthy parchment scroll covered in dense writing. The ancient scroll is unusual in that Atuuks have only recently acquired written language, and their modern script bears no resemblance to the writing on the scroll. Thus the Atuuks cannot read the scroll, but they presume it outlines their extensive tribal genealogies from times past.</Description>

    <Name>Final Orders for 8th Fleet</Name>
    <Description>A damaged partial recording of the final orders issued to the 8th Fleet of the human Solar Republic, which was engaged with enemy forces allied to something called the "Shaktur Axis".  The importance of 8th Fleet's area to the overall war effort is emphasized.    The gist of the surviving excerpt is that no further reinforcements can be expected due to a massive and hopefully decisive combined operation which is about to begin against the main Shakturi center of gravity.  Until this operation is completed, 8th Fleet is ordered to delay enemy allied operations and prevent bombardment or assault of key colonies within its area of operations, at all costs.  The Gizurean Hive is mentioned as one of the enemies facing 8th Fleet.</Description>

    <Name>The Glaive of Mor</Name>
    <Description>An unusual weapon, Mortalen in style but Zenox in manufacture and made of an extremely advanced alloy.  It consists of multiple angled blades around a central disc and seems designed and balanced for throwing.  As with other ancient Mortalen weapons, it also contains a miniature generator within, which both energizes the blades and accelerates the disc to its target as well as then returning it expeditiously to its wielder, who wears a matching bracer which interlocks with this weapon.  Something else about the energy field around this weapon also seems to increase aggression at a remarkable range, even to most of the surface of planet.</Description>

    <Name>"The Epic of the Betrayal"</Name>
    <Description>An ancient Zenox epic poem contained in a pyramid-shaped hologram projector, which when activated displays and recounts the tale in a dramatic audio-visual reading.  On the surface, it tells a tale of a great and ancient tragedy from two perspectives, in which a brother in dire circumstances betrays  and murders his sibling in order to save his own life.  The epic begins from the point of view of the murdered brother, but then explains in cold detail the reasoning of the betrayer in such a way that by the end, the listener finds themselves tied in a knot, no longer sure of who to trust or what is right.  To the ancient Zenox, this was high art because of its ability to capture the complexity and nuance they saw in morality and the interactions of sentient beings.</Description>

    <Description>An ancient monolithic data storage device, weathered but functional.  The ancient Haakonish appear to have stored a significant portion of their cultural works on the subjects of preparing and eating fine food as well as artifice and subterfuge.  The Haakonish who wrote these works found that through the intersection of those two arts, they could find exploitable weaknesses in other inferior cultures through the analysis of their culinary preferences and customs.  Throughout these works, the superiority of Haakonish gastronomy, partly due to their superior biology, is often and repeatedly asserted as self-evident.  Perhaps most interesting, many of the finest Haakonish dishes make use of Korabbian Spice and several ancient locations where it may perhaps still be found are recorded herein.</Description>

The only downside is that something in the unalterable base code causes any individual who makes repeated use of the chamber to gradually take on more Haakonish characteristics.</Description>

    <Name>Altar of Darkness</Name>
    <Description>A powerful ancient artifact in the shape of an altar made of some kind of alloy which absorbs light, except where purple "veins" of energy cris-cross the surface and pulse with energy.  It appears completely undamaged and anyone approaching the vicinity realizes that it is inhabited by some kind of consciousness with telepathic abilities.  Those who stay for more than a moment are psychically enslaved to a new ideology known as the Way oF Darkness.   Those who are slaves of the altar then act as conduits for its telepathy to reach others.  Without a method of psychic containment, its control can spread across an entire planet in short order.</Description>
