Resources are the raw materials found at planets, moons and asteroids. These can include metallic ores, gases, minerals, textiles, foods, beverages, and many other items.

Mining valuable resources is an important part of your empire’s economy.

Some resources are used in constructing new ships and bases. Other resources are used to raise the development of your colonies - these are luxury resources. And one resource (Caslon) is used as a universal reactor fuel.

[H3]Mining Locations[/H3]
Mining occurs at both fixed mining stations and mobile mining ships.

Mining stations are bases that are built at resource-rich locations. They extract resources, which are then transported by freighters to your nearest spaceport.

Mining ships are mobile resource extraction ships. They seek out locations with resources that are in high demand, mining these resources and returning them to your nearest spaceport.

[H3]Using Mined Resources[/H3]
Once mined resources reach a spaceport they can be used. For construction resources this could mean using them to build new ships or bases. Or the resources may be sold to another empire.

All resource usage and trading happens automatically - mining stations, mining ships and freighters are all privately owned. They go about their business without any state input. You cannot assign missions to these types of ships.

[H3]How to Exploit Resources[/H3]
As ruler and manager of your empire, your tasks with mining for resources are:
[ULI]exploring for new resource locations using exploration ships[/ULI]
[ULI]building mining stations at resource-rich locations using construction ships[/ULI]

The New Mining Locations list (shift-F7) allows you to quickly identify valuable resources and build mining stations to obtain them. The Resources list (F6) contains detailed filters to find specific resources throughout the galaxy.

The Resource Flow map overlay helps you to see the sources and destinations for resources in your empire.
