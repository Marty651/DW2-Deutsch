This screen shows you locations you have explored that have special research bonuses. These locations are where you should build new research stations. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. You can filter by specific research bonuses to quickly identify new locations for a particular research area.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the new research locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. This helps you to easily see where a location is in relation to others.

Clicking a list item will select it. Double-clicking an item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the research bonuses at the location. Hover over the bonus description for a complete summary of all research bonuses at the location, including where they come from. 

[H3]Queuing New Research Stations[/H3]
The button at the right allows you to queue construction of a new research station at the location. When the next construction ship becomes available it will build a research station here. You can click the button again to cancel construction.

If you cannot build at the location the Queue button will be disabled. A tooltip on the button will explain why you cannot build there.

[H3]Dangerous Locations[/H3]
A red lightning bolt symbol will be shown next to the location name if the location is considered dangerous. A location is dangerous when there are uncleared threats present, like pirates or deadly space creatures.

Non-military ships will not travel to a dangerous location. The threats must first be cleared by military ships or a fleet. This means that while you can queue construction of new research stations at a dangerous location, construction ships will not go there to build the new station until the threats are cleared.
