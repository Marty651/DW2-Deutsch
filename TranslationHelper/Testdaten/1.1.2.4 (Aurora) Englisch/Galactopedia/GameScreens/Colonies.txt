Colonies are the populated worlds in your empire. They provide most of the wealth and income of your empire. You take a portion of that income by taxing your colonies.

Over time colonies grow in both population and development level. Larger, more developed colonies provide higher income.

To grow your colonies faster you should work at keeping the population happy. You can also accelerate colony growth by allocating funding in the Funding Levels screen in Your Empire section.
