Construction Yards are where you build new ships for your empire. This includes spaceports, which are usually the fastest way to build new ships. Your colonies can also build ships and bases.

[H3]Construction Yard List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the current construction yards in your empire. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. You can sort by construction speed or current construction wait time.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the construction yards are highlighted on the map. System and Location badges also indicate spaceports using the yellow construction icon. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it's location. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

[H3]Construction Queue and Wait Time[/H3]
Each list item shows the current construction wait time. This is the time before any new construction will commence.

Also shown are the ships or bases in the construction queue, including any ships incoming for repair or retrofit (not yet arrived). Hover over each ship or base for more details, including the construction progress percentage.

Hovering a list item will also display a summary panel at the right. This summary shows how many individual construction yards the location has. It also shows the current wait time and the build and repair speeds.
