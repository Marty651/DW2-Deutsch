Your empire consists of your colonies – worlds where you have a loyal population.

[H3]State vs Private[/H3]
The citizens of your colonies act independently from you and form your Private economy. They actively seek to improve their colonies and increase their wealth.

Thus these citizens seek out business opportunities trading in-demand goods between your colonies. When you have trade treaties with independent colonies and other empires, your citizens will also expand their trade activities to include these new opportunities.

Hardy citizens will also form mining expeditions – using mining ships to extract valuable resources all over the explored galaxy and returning them to your spaceports for use.

The population on each of your colonies will grow over time, eventually reaching a natural limit on each type of world. As the population grows it produces more income, providing a larger tax base to fund your empire.

A summary of your empire’s State and Private economies are displayed in the Empire Economy Screen (F2).

The various types of Income and Expenses are explained in detail below:

[H2]State Income[/H2]
Your State economy is funded by several main sources of income outlined below:

[H3]Colony Tax Revenue[/H3]
You can directly adjust colony tax rates. This allows you to collect more revenue from each colony. However, the higher you raise taxes, the more evasion there will be – some of your citizens will find ways to avoid paying. Also, higher taxes lower colony happiness and wealth production.

[H3]Ship Construction[/H3]
Expanding your empire with new colonies stimulates demand for new freighters and mining ships from your private citizens. These ship purchases at your construction yards add more money to your state economy.

[H3]Trade Transaction Fees[/H3]
Fees are charged on each transaction at your spaceports and mining stations, earning income for your empire. Thus it is important to ensure free and safe trade to these locations. You should patrol your space ports and mining stations and chase away any threats such as pirates, aggressive space creatures or enemy empires.

[H3]Trade Bonus Income[/H3]
When your empire has trade bonuses then you earn extra income on each transaction at your spaceports, colonies and mining stations.

Trade Income bonuses can come from certain government types. Some alien races also have natural trade bonuses. Some planetary facilities and wonders also provide trade bonuses.

[H3]Trade Agreements[/H3]
You gain income when you form Trade Agreements with other empires. In this situation a percentage of the entire trade volume between the two empires is earned as bonus income by each empire. Over time the bonus percentage grows until it reaches a maximum limit.

[H3]Tourism at Resorts[/H3]
Your empires Resort Bases earn income when tourists travel to them.

[H3]Economic Strategy[/H3]
Thus your strategy for boosting state income should include the following:
[ULI]Keep expanding your empire with new colonies – this stimulates trade and causes your private citizens to purchase more freighters and other ships[/ULI]
[ULI]Ensure safe trade routes for freighters transporting goods to your colonies – higher level development at colonies means more tax income[/ULI]
[ULI]Seek trade agreements with friendly empires to supplement your income. You reap bonus income from the total trade volume between your two empires[/ULI]
[ULI]Build Resort Bases at locations with Scenery bonuses[/ULI]

[H3]Regular Expenses[/H3]
The state economy of your empire has three major regular expenses:
[ULI]Maintenance costs for ships and bases[/ULI]
[ULI]Maintenance costs for troops[/ULI]
[ULI]Maintenance costs for planetary facilities[/ULI]

Maintenance costs can be controlled by carefully balancing the number of ships, troops and facilities in your empire. Only build ships that you need. Only recruit troops that you need. Only build facilities that you need.

[H3]Excess Income and Funding Levels[/H3]
It is also possible to allocate excess income to be spent in two important areas:
[ULI]Colony Growth Funding: spend a portion of excess income to accelerate growth at your colonies[/ULI]
[ULI]Research: spend a portion of excess income to accelerate Research speed[/ULI]

Examine the Empire Funding Levels screen for more details (shift-F2).

[H3]Irregular Expenses[/H3]
Other expenses are irregular and non-recurring:
[ULI]State Ship Building: cost to build new state-owned ships and bases[/ULI]
[ULI]Troop Recruitment: cost to recruit new troop units[/ULI]
[ULI]Facility Construction: cost to build new planetary facilities and wonders[/ULI]
[ULI]Resource Purchase from Other Empires: costs of buying resources from other empires[/ULI]
[ULI]Tribute: this includes gifts to other empires and Pirate Protection fees[/ULI]
[ULI]Fuel: fuel costs for you state-owned ships and bases[/ULI]
