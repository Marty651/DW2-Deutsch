The populations at each of your colonies all have an opinion of you as their ruler. You must be careful to maintain the approval of the majority of the population or else they may be inclined to rebel or even leave your empire.

You should aim to keep colony approval at 5 or higher. Anything below this level risks rebellion should a sudden change in happiness occur, such as by a natural disaster or enemy intelligence mission.
 
[H3]Factors influencing approval[/H3]
Many factors can influence your approval at each colony:
[ULI]Tax rate - lower the better[/ULI]
[ULI]Development level - higher the better[/ULI]
[ULI]Planet suitability - higher the better[/ULI]
[ULI]High Corruption increases unhappiness[/ULI]

There may be special circumstances which lower the approval rating for particular colonies:
[ULI]Recently Conquered planets are unhappy[/ULI]
[ULI]Colonies with poorly assimilated populations are less happy[/ULI]
[ULI]Recent pirate raids against a colony increase unhappiness[/ULI]
[ULI]War with an empire of the same race as a colony – if you are at war with an empire, and some of your colonies have the same dominant race as that empire, then this will lower your approval rating at those colonies[/ULI]
[ULI]Low planet quality - if the planet or moon has low quality (either naturally or due to enemy bombardment) then the citizens of the colony will be unhappy[/ULI]

Other factors have an impact on all the colonies in your empire:
[ULI]War weariness - if you are involved in wars against other empires – especially for an extended period – then your approval rating will drop with all citizens throughout your empire[/ULI]
[ULI]Poor reputation - some alien races can become quite concerned if your empire has a poor reputation, lowering your approval rating[/ULI]

Strive to maintain a high approval rating by ensuring your colonies have high development levels. This is achieved by securing the trade routes to and from your colonies so that luxury resources can safely reach them.

Also, be careful not to raise taxes too high – it’s usually a good idea to allow colony taxes to be automatically controlled (default setting in Game Options).

[H3]Maximum Population[/H3]
Colony populations eventually reach a natural limit, at which point no further population growth will occur. This limit is determined by two factors:
[ULI]Suitability of the planet for the population: higher suitability increases maximum population level[/ULI]
[ULI]Size of world: larger worlds allow for higher maximum population levels[/ULI]

[H3]Population Growth[/H3]
The overall growth rate of a colony is strongly related to the overall suitability of the planet for the population living there. More suitable colonies will grow much faster.

The population level will also influence growth rate. Small colonies have faster population growth: when a colony has less than a quarter of it's maximum population, then population growth is doubled.

Between 25% and 75% of it's maximum population, colony population grows at the normal rate.

Once a colony reaches 75% of it's maximum population, then population growth is halved.

[H3]Migration[/H3]
Migration of your citizens from large colonies to smaller ones is a major factor in achieving fast growth of new colonies. Citizens will be naturally attracted to nearby colonies with low taxes and good development levels. They will board passenger ships and migrate to those new colonies, boosting the population there.

[H3]Colony Growth Funding[/H3]
You can further accelerate colony growth by directing your empire's excess income to Colony Growth Funding. 

You can set the Colony Growth Funding level in the Empire Funding Levels screen (shift-F2). This is a good way to use excess income to grow your empire faster.

Of course you also need to balance how you use your income in other areas. You need to have sufficient money to buy new ships and bases, recruit troops, build new facilities and perform research. You also need adequate funds to pay the maintenance costs for your ships, troops and facilities.

[H3]Benefits of Researching Colonization Techs[/H3]
As outlined elsewhere in this topic, colony suitability is very important for the following reasons:
[ULI]increases maximum population[/ULI]
[ULI]increases population growth rate[/ULI]
[ULI]increases happiness, and thus effectively increases income[/ULI]

So increasing colony suitability is highly beneficial for your colonies.

One simple way to increase suitability is through researching the colonization projects in the Research screen.

The colonization techs reduce the threshold at which an empire can colonize specific planet types. This improves the suitability formula for these planets, even when they are already colonized.

So be sure to research these projects, especially for the planet type of your homeworld and other large colonies.

[H3]Colony Revenue[/H3]
To achieve maximum revenue from your colonies you must help them develop to their fullest potential.

Colony income is calculated as follows:

Colony Income = Total Population x Development Level

Thus to maximize revenue you must maximize both the population and development of each colony.

Fast population growth and high colony development level are both achieved via the same methods:
[ULI]Keep taxes at a reasonable level[/ULI]
[ULI]Ensure a good supply of luxury resources[/ULI]

[H3]Colony Development Level: Population + Luxury Resources[/H3]
As explained further below, colony development level is comprised of two parts: up to 50% from population + remainder from luxury resources

[H3]Development from Population[/H3]
When a colony has a population of 5 billion, it's population development reaches the maximum level of 50%. Smaller populations have proportionally less population development. For example a new colony of 30 million has a population development level of approximately 14%.

[H3]Development from Luxury Resources[/H3]
Luxury resources are the high-end goods that your population consumes. They come in various forms: food, beverages, textiles, exotic minerals and timbers, and many others. They directly increase development, because each of these resources has a Colony Development bonus of a specific amount.

Luxury resources are consumed by colonies. Having access to many luxury resources raises a colony’s luxury development level, producing more income. Each luxury resource raises the development level by a specific amount (typically 3-6%, but each resource differs), thus when a colony has consistent access to many luxury resources its luxury development level will slowly rise.

So a key consideration when growing your colonies is to maintain and expand a steady supply of luxury resources.

[H3]Overall Development Level[/H3]
Combining both population development and luxury development gives the total colony development level.

Once total colony development reaches 120%, further increases taper off. So additional luxury resources beyond 120% only add a portion of their development bonus. Even so, when a colony is supplied with many luxury resources it can reach very high development levels, well beyond 100%.

[H3]Revenue slowdown[/H3]
Once a colony reaches 50% of its maximum population, additional revenue reduces. Population over 50% of maximum produces revenue at half the rate of population below that level.

This means that while very large colonies can produce a lot of money, the increase is not strictly linear.
