GREETING_FRIENDLY			;What topic shall we discuss with our dear friend?
GREETING_NEUTRAL			;There's something you'd like to talk about?
GREETING_ANGRY				;State your case quickly - we have little time for you

OFFER_FREETRADE				;We come before you to offer a Free Trade Agreement.\n\nThis treaty would be highly profitable for both of our empires. And we could export some of our exquisite food and wine to you!\n\nDo you agree?
FREETRADE_ACCEPT			;We eagerly accept your offer of a Free Trade Agreement!\n\nTo kick things off, please try this delicious sample of Bakdur steak that we've sent to you!

CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;How unfortunate that you no longer value our friendship. But that is your choice
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;Treaties come and treaties go. But the important things remain: singing and dancing, eating and drinking
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_ANGRY		;No loss to us - this was a worthless treaty anyway. Much like your worthless little empire!

TREATY_PROPOSAL				;What is your offer?
TREATY_ACCEPTRESPONSE			;We are overjoyed at your acceptance! We will now compose a song in honor of this great occasion!

TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE			;We have cooked up a little something for you: Trade Sanctions!\n\nYour provocations have forced us to terminate all trade between our two empires.\n\nHopefully this lesson will teach you to be civilized
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_ANGRY	;You're quite an evil little despot, aren't you!\n\nBut we will not be broken by mere trade sanctions!
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL	;We are not impressed by your pitiful Trade Sanctions.\n\nWe will now ignore you...
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_SURPRISED	;Why do you impose Trade Sanctions on your friends?!\n\nYou cannot possibly be serious...
TRADESANCTIONS_LIFT			;We have decided to end our Trade Sanctions against you.\n\nNormal trade will now resume
TRADESANCTIONS_LIFT_RESPONSE		;We knew you could not hold out for long without access to our delicious Bakdur steak!\n\nLet that be a lesson to you

WAR_DECLARE				;It is with great sadness that we must inform you of the following: a state of war now exists between us.\n\nWe must end your treacherous activities once and for all!
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_EAGER		;Yet another foolish decision from you!\n\nThis war will be your end. Prepare for annihilation!
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;We will fight with courage and intensity!\n\nThe suffering will be upon you, not us
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_SURPRISED		;What?! Are we no longer friends?!\n\nThere must be some mistake...

WAR_END					;We urge an end to this futile war between us.\n\nWhat do you say?

WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY	;We are not aware of any missions against you my friend, but we will investigate this situation at once
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL	;Be assured that we will investigate this incident
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_ANGRY	;Covert missions? What missions? If there were any missions, we certainly wouldn't talk to you about them. But there are no missions anyway... So stop being so paranoid!
WARNING_ATTACKS					;Your unprovoked miltary attacks ignite an angry fire in us!\n\nDo not stoke this fire any more, or it may burn you up!
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;How terrible, please accept our sincere apologies for any overzealous actions of our military commanders
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;We will investigate this incident and deal with the offending military commander
