You can fine-tune how your income is spent in the Bonus Funding Levels screen. Hover over each value for a detailed explanation.

[H3]Allocating Maintenance Funding[/H3]
In this screen you can set percentage values for each of your main regular expense areas: Ship and Base Maintenance, Troop Maintenance and Facility Maintenance. These percentages will limit how much your advisors are willing to spend in each area.

Thus if you allocate 50% of your income to Ship Maintenance, then your advisors will be willing to build ships and bases up to a maintenance limit of 50% of your economy. But they will not recommend new ships once you reach the specified limit.

Limiting spending in each area allows more even apportionment of your income to all the areas of your economy, preventing overspending in one area.

You can also specify a percentage of your income that is left unspent, thus building up a cash stockpile that can be used for purchases and other expenses.

[H3]Excess Funding for Colony Growth and Research[/H3]
Any Excess income can be directed to either Colony Growth or Research. Allocating funding for these 2 areas will increase the rate of Colony Growth or the speed of Research your empire can perform.

If you automate Funding Levels then your economic advisors will use any excess income to maintain full Research speed while directing the remainder to Colony Growth rates.
