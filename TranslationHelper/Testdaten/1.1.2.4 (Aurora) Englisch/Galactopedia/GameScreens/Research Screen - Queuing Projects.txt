Hovering over a project will present a summary of the project, including the benefits it unlocks. As you hover longer, a more detailed summary is displayed, with comprehensive data on the project benefits.

Note that you can also hover over projects in the research queue, and the 'Queue Suggested Project' button.

[H3]Queuing a Project for Research[/H3]
Left-click a project to queue it for research.

Right-click a project to remove it from the research queue.

[H3]Initiation Costs[/H3]
Some projects require an initiation cost to be paid before research can begin. The cost may include money and resources.

When you left-click to queue a project that has initiation costs, a prompt window will popup asking you to approve payment of the costs.

[H3]Extra Requirements[/H3]
Some projects have extra research bonus requirements before you can begin researching them. This means that they can only be initiated when you have sufficient research bonuses of a particular type, e.g. some high-end Shield projects require you to have a certain threshold of Shield research bonuses.

You can obtain research bonuses in specific areas by seeking out these locations through exploration. When you find an area with special research bonuses you can then build a research station there to obtain those bonuses for your empire.

[H3]Crash Research[/H3]
You can accelerate research of an important project by 'crash-researching' it. This means spending money to double the research rate for that project.

To crash research a project:
[ULI]ensure the project is currently being researched, i.e. is the top project in the queue[/ULI]
[ULI]click the project in the view[/ULI]
[ULI]a prompt window will appear asking you to approve payment to crash research the project[/ULI]
