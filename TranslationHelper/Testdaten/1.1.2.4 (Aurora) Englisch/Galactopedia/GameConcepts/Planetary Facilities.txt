Planetary Facilities are buildings that you construct at colonies. They provide bonuses or special abilities to the colony.

Before you can build a facility you must first research it. Facilities cost money to build. They also have ongoing maintenance costs. You can only build one of each type of facility at a colony.

[H3]Building and viewing facilities[/H3]
You can build facilities at a colony by selecting the colony in the Selection Panel and then clicking the green 'Build Facilities' button. This will open a set of buttons with all of the facilities that can be built at the colony.

You can see all of the facilities in your empire in the Planetary Facilities list (Colonies section).

For details on each facility refer to the individual topics in the Planetary Facilities section.
