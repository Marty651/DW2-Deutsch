A key objective of any war is to take and hold territory from your opponent. In this case your opponents territory primarily consists of their colonies.

Invading an enemy colony involves landing ground troops from your ships. Once landed your troops then battle it out with any defending troops of the other empire.

Note that you can display a detailed animated view of ground battles by opening the Ground Report screen. To open this screen first select the colony in the Selection Panel, then click the Troops area in the Selection Panel.

[H3]Initiating an invasion[/H3]
To initiate an invasion of an enemy colony, select one of your troop-carrying ships, or even an entire fleet. Then right-click on an enemy colony to attack it.

When ordering a fleet to invade, the fleet will check whether there are enough attacking troops at the location. The invasion will commence once enough troops (onboard transports) have arrived at the location.

Any ships carrying troops will then attempt to deploy them in an invasion.

[H3]Landing Process[/H3]
To land your invasion troops requires your ships to get close to the colony. When they are within range the ships will launch troops on Assault Pods, which will then travel to the planetary surface.

While they are travelling to the planet surface, Assault Pods are vulnerable to intercepting fire from enemy weapons and defending Planetary Defense troops. Any Planetary Shield at the colony will also damage the invading troops.

Once your troops have landed on the planet the ground battle will commence.
