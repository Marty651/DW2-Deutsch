The Design Bays list shows all of the component bays in the hull.

The components added to the Design Bays list is the core of the design. The components added here define the capabilities and behavior of the design.

Each bay has a type and size. You can only place components in a bay when it is a matching type and when the component size fits within the bay.

There are 6 component bay types. Each bay type only allows certain types of components:
[ULI]General: command centers, crew quarters, fuel cells, reactors, hyperdrives, cargo bays, passenger compartments, troop compartments, mining engines, energy collectors and all others[/ULI]
[ULI]Weapons: weapons or tractor beams[/ULI]
[ULI]Engines: engines and vectoring engines[/ULI]
[ULI]Defense: armor, shields or damage control[/ULI]
[ULI]Hangars: docking bays, construction yards or fighter bays[/ULI]
[ULI]Sensors: scanners, countermeasures, targeting computers, survey modules, scanner jammers[/ULI]

To add a component to a bay:
[OLI]select the desired component from the Available Components list[/OLI]
[OLI]find a bay of the matching type and adequate size in the Design Bays list[/OLI]
[OLI]left-click in the bay to place the component[/OLI]

You can also do the following:
[ULI]when you hover over a bay that already contains a component, a popup comparison window will be displayed. This allows you to quickly see the differences between them[/ULI]
[ULI]right-click a bay to remove an existing component[/ULI]

[H3]External Bays[/H3]
Note that some component bays are external on the preview model. In other words, they can be seen on the exterior of the ship or base.

External bays are shown in the Design Bays list by a 'view' icon at the left. You can click the view icon to rotate the preview to show the external bay.
