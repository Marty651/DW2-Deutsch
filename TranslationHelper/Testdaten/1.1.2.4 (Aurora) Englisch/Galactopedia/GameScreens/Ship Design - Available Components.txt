The Available Components list shows all of the researched components that are available to add to the design.

Only components that are valid for the role are shown. Thus fighters do not see any ship components, and vice versa. Components will also be excluded if they are too large for any bays in the hull.

You can further filter the components using the dropdown list at the top-left of the panel. This allows you to filter by bay type, or to just show the latest component per category.

You can sort the components using the dropdown list at the top-right of the panel. This allows you to sort by name, category, tech level or size.

[H3]Component Summary[/H3]
As you hover over each component a popup summary will appear at the right, outlining the component specs.
