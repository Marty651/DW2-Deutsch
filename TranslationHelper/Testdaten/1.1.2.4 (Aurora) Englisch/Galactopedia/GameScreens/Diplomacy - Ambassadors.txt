Any ambassador characters in your empire are shown in this list.

You can see the details of each ambassador by hovering over the list entry and clicking to lock open the panel at the right.

You can change an ambassador's name by clicking on their name under the portrait and typing a new one.

[H3]Ambassador Location[/H3]
Ambassadors apply diplomatic and espionage benefits to your relationship with another faction. To assign an ambassador to a particular faction you should send them to the faction's capital.

Use the location dropdown list and the 'Transfer' button to assign them to the desired faction.

Alternatively you can automate the ambassador so that your diplomatic advisors will select the best location for them. Use the 'Automate' button under the ambassador portrait at the right.

[H3]Events[/H3]
At the very bottom of the detail panel is a list of all the events that the ambassador has been involved with. Various events can improve or decrease their skills, or provide new character traits.
