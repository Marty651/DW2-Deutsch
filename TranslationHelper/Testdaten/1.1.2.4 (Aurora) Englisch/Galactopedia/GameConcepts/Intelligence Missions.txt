Intelligence missions enable you to secretly infiltrate other empires and steal or destroy their assets.

[H3]Spies[/H3]
Spies are the highly-trained and skilled specialists that you use to accomplish these missions.

Spies become more skilled with each successful mission. The more skilled a spy is, the more difficult a mission they can take on.

Conversely, it only takes one failed mission to get your spy killed or captured, so choose your missions wisely.

[H3]Counter Intelligence[/H3]
Counter-intelligence is also critical to protect your empire. You can assign spies to prevent enemy intelligence missions – they will actively seek out spies and saboteurs and report any discoveries to you. Counter-intelligence uses the Counter Espionage skill.

[H3]Diplomatic fallout[/H3]
Beware of the negative fallout from botched intelligence missions – if another empire discovers your actions against them it will dramatically lower their estimation of your empire, and could even lead to war.

Infiltrate an empire, providing ongoing intelligence on their Galaxy Map and Operations Map, i.e. you can see all of their ships, bases and colonies.
