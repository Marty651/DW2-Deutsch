This screen lists potential new resort locations that you can target. These locations are where you should build new resort bases. Resorts are destinations for tourism. Passenger ships will transport tourists to resorts, earning income for your empire.

Resorts are built at scenic locations in the galaxy. These locations usually have some natural scenic feature. Ancient ruins can also provide scenery bonuses that can be exploited by building a Resort Base there.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the new resort locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the known scenery bonuses at the location. Hover over the scenery bonus description for a full summary, including the natural feature that provides the bonus.

[H3]Queuing New Resort Bases[/H3]
The button at the right allows you to queue construction of a new resort base at the location. When the next construction ship becomes available it will build a resort base here. You can click the button again to cancel construction.

If you cannot build at the location the Queue button will be disabled. A tooltip on the button will explain why you cannot build there.

[H3]Dangerous Locations[/H3]
A red lightning bolt symbol will be shown next to the location name if the location is considered dangerous. A location is dangerous when there are uncleared threats present, like pirates or deadly space creatures.

Non-military ships will not travel to a dangerous location. The threats must first be cleared by military ships or a fleet. This means that while you can queue construction of new resort base at a dangerous location, construction ships will not go there to build the new base until the threats are cleared.
