The top section of your State Economy shows regular anticipated income and expenses. These amounts change slowly over time as your empire grows.

The bottom section of your State Economy shows irregular bonus income. These amounts can vary widely, often being comprised of private ship building income, where the private sector of your empire buys new ships.

[H3]Private Economy[/H3]
The Private Economy section shows the income and expenses of the private sector of your empire. You have no direct control over how the private sector earns or spends money.
