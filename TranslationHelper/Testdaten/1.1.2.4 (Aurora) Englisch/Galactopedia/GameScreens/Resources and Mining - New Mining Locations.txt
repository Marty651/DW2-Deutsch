This screen lists potential new mining locations that you can target. These locations are where you should build new mining stations.

Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. The filter options allow you to target specific resources. Yellow-colored filter items are construction resources used to build new ships and bases. Light blue filter items are luxury resources used to develop your colonies.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the new mining locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the known resources and abundance levels at the location. If your empire has a shortage of the resource it will be surrounded by a dashed red border. Hover over each resource for a full summary, including any bonuses it provides.

[H3]Queuing New Mining Stations[/H3]
The button at the right allows you to queue construction of a new mining station at the location. When the next construction ship becomes available it will build a mining station here. You can click the button again to cancel construction.

If you cannot build at the location the Queue button will be disabled. A tooltip on the button will explain why you cannot build there.

[H3]Dangerous Locations[/H3]
A red lightning bolt symbol will be shown next to the location name if the location is considered dangerous. A location is dangerous when there are uncleared threats present, like pirates or deadly space creatures.

Non-military ships will not travel to a dangerous location. The threats must first be cleared by military ships or a fleet. This means that while you can queue construction of new mining stations at a dangerous location, construction ships will not go there to build the new station until the threats are cleared.
