Colonies are the populated worlds in your empire. They are the critical element in the game â€“ they produce the wealth that powers your empire.

Colonies provide tax income to fund your government. However they take time to grow, so be careful to concentrate your defenses (troops and ships) on your well-established colonies. These core colonies are the key to your initial growth.

[H3]Colonizing new worlds[/H3]
To create new colonies you must build colony ships and send them out to claim planets for your empire. When a new colony is established the colony ship is consumed and disappears.

Colonies can usually only be established in systems that are not already part of another empire's territory.

But independent colonies are an exception - they can be colonized even when they are in another empire's territory. However doing this will offend the empire that the system belongs to, negatively impacting your relations with them.

[H3]Planet Suitability[/H3]
To be a viable colony a planet or moon must be sufficiently suitable for the alien race that colonizes it. Each alien race has some planet types that they are more suited to. These are their 'native' planet types. This means that they are likely to find suitable colonization targets amongst these planet types.

Planet suitability is determined by a race's characteristics and the quality of the planet itself.

Each planet type has a typical range of quality values. For example Sandy Desert planets have a quality range from 25% to 50%.

The formula for calculating suitability for a specific planet type and race can be expressed as follows:

(Planet Quality - Race Minimum Suitability Level for Planet) + Race Suitability for Planet

An example: Teekans have a +30 suitability boost for Sandy Desert planets. In addition they have a minimum suitability level of 40 for Sandy Desert planets (the default value is 50). This means that for Teekans a Sandy Desert planet with a quality of 30% would have a colonization suitability of +20. Using the formula above this would be: ((30 - 40) + 30) = 20

[H3]Selecting Colonization Targets and Further Improvements[/H3]
Usually you should only colonize planets with a suitability of 20 or higher.

However sometimes you may choose to colonize a planet even when suitability is below 20. For example the planet may be in a very strategic location, or it may have special bonuses.

But remember that low suitability planets are a net drain on your empire's resources: they cost more money to maintain than they earn.

The importance of suitability extends beyond just evaluating whether a planet can be colonized. More suitable colonies earn more income, have happier populations and grow faster.

Suitability can be improved in a number of ways:
[ULI]colonization research can unlock improved suitability for various planet types[/ULI]
[ULI]terraforming research can allow improvement of planet quality[/ULI]
[ULI]incorporating more suitable alien races into your empire who can then colonize planets suitable to them[/ULI]

[H3]Independent Colonies and their Benefits[/H3]
You can always colonize any planet with a pre-existing independent alien population, because the existing population is already suited to the planet.

Independent colonies are valuable colonization targets because the large, already-established population gives your colony a head-start, allowing it to quickly start earning income for your empire.

There is another key bonus from targeting independent colonies for colonization: independent aliens can often colonize other types of planets and moons that your own race cannot. Thus you can use these other races to establish colonies at additional planets that you could not otherwise colonize.

[H3]Colonizing Independent Worlds[/H3]
Most independent colonies will not welcome colonization unless you have first built up a friendship with them.

You can improve relations with independent colonies by forming trade treaties and offering gifts. Eventually they may warm up to you enough that they extend an invitation to colonize. At that point you can send a Colony Ship to the planet and colonize, integrating the world into your empire.

[H3]Invading Independent Worlds[/H3]
Unfortunately some species may be so hostile that they never warm up to your diplomacy.

So you can also choose to invade independent colonies, landing troops to conquer them and take the planet by force.

But note that invading independent colonies will harm your diplomatic reputation with other factions. It will also result in a highly unhappy newly-conquered colony that will require a strong troop garrison to quell any rebellious elements.
