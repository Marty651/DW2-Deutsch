Not all alien life is part of a formal empire. Many alien populations operate independently. These populations are located on worlds spread across the galaxy.

These independent colonies mine the resources on their worlds and offer these in trade to others. In this case you can benefit from these resources without having to build a mining station at the world.

While independent populations start off not belonging to an empire, they can be absorbed into an empire through colonization.

[H3]Colonizing Independent Worlds[/H3]
Most independent colonies will not welcome colonization unless you have first built up a friendship with them.

You can improve relations with independent colonies by forming trade treaties and offering gifts. Eventually they may warm up to you enough that they extend an invitation to colonize. At that point you can send a Colony Ship to the planet and colonize, integrating the world into your empire.

[H3]Invading Independent Worlds[/H3]
Unfortunately some species may be so hostile that they never warm up to your diplomacy.

So you can also choose to invade independent colonies, landing troops to conquer them and take the planet by force.

But note that invading independent colonies will harm your diplomatic reputation with other factions. It will also result in a highly unhappy newly-conquered colony that will require a strong troop garrison to quell any rebellious elements.

[H3]Independent Traders[/H3]
Independent traders are usually present along with independent colonies. These traders operate freighters which work at transporting cargo across the galaxy. They can often be found waiting at an independent world, ready to transport a cargo order to its buyer.

The identifying color for independent colonies and traders is light gray.
