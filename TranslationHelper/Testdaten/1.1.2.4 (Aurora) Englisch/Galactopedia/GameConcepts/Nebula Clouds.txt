Nebula Clouds are a major feature of the galaxy. Vast clouds of gas and dust spread across the expanse of the galaxy.

[H3]Effect on Hyperspace Travel[/H3]
Nebula clouds inhibit hyperspace travel, greatly slowing the jump speed of ships when inside them.

For this reason ships typically plot jump paths around nebulae instead of travelling directly through them.

Thus nebulae form natural barriers that shape the galaxy.

[H3]Effect on Long Range Scanners[/H3]
Long range scanners are inhibited by nebulae. Their scan range is greatly reduced when inside a nebulae.

Nebulae also act as a barrier that blocks scanning of objects on the other side. So you cannot see ships or bases on the other side of a nebula cloud. In other words, you cannot 'scan through' nebulae.

[H2]Other Nebulae Effects[/H2]
All nebula clouds slow hyperspace travel and inhibit sensors. However some nebulae also have other effects, as outlined below:

[H3]Galactic Storm[/H3]
Galactic Storms are dangerous nebulae regions with periodic charged lightning strikes. They can inflict the following types of damage on ships or bases:
[ULI]Standard Damage: 7 max (mitigate with Reactive Armor)[/ULI]

[H3]Ion Storm[/H3]
Ion Storms emit damaging ion radiation that can disable the components of unprotected ships or bases. They also have a constant energy drain, causing ships to expend more reactor power and thus more fuel.
[ULI]Ion Damage: 4 max (mitigate with Ion Defense)[/ULI]
[ULI]Energy Drain: -1/sec[/ULI]

[H3]Gravitic Storm[/H3]
Gravitic Storms emit intense bursts of gravitic energy that can damage or disable unprotected ships or bases. They also slow the speed of sub-light travel for any ships inside them. They have the following effects:
[ULI]Ion Damage: 8 max (mitigate with Ion Defense)[/ULI]
[ULI]Standard Damage: 5 max (mitigate with Reactive Armor)[/ULI]
[ULI]Speed Modifier: -50%[/ULI]

[H3]Radiation Zone[/H3]
Radiation Zones are areas of intense radiation that drains energy and shields. They also greatly reduce the effectiveness of sensors.
[ULI]Energy Drain: -15/sec[/ULI]
[ULI]Sensors Disabled: -30[/ULI]
[ULI]Shields Reduced: -6/sec[/ULI]

[H2]Nebulae Map Overlay[/H2]
You can see the precise boundaries of nebula clouds by turning on the Nebulae map overlay. This overlay shows the outlines of all known nebulae.

The nebulae markers are colored according to the type of nebulae:
[ULI]Standard Nebulae: Grey[/ULI]
[ULI]Galactic Storm: Orange[/ULI]
[ULI]Ion Storm: Purple[/ULI]
[ULI]Gravitic Storm: Green[/ULI]
[ULI]Radiation Zone: Yellow[/ULI]
