Taxes on your empire's colonies are your primary source of income.

The population of each colony goes about their private business, generating wealth. Your empire then taxes this revenue generated by your private citizens.

[H3]Private Colony Revenue[/H3]
This relationship of private revenue to state tax revenue is shown in the Economy screen (F2). 

The Private Economy > Annual Income section has the row 'Private Colony Revenue' which shows how much overall income your colonies generate.

The State Economy > Annual Income section has the row 'Colony Tax' which shows how much total tax income you make from your colonies. This tax take is a portion of the 'Private Colony Revenue' mentioned above.

[H3]Colony Revenue Formula[/H3]
Private colony income is calculated as follows:

Colony Income = Total Population x Development Level

This private colony income is what your empire taxes, generating income for your empire. Thus to maximize tax revenue you must help grow your colonies, maximizing both the population and development of each colony.

[H3]Setting tax rates[/H3]
Colony tax rates can be set anywhere from zero up to 100%. If the citizens at the colony think the tax rate is too high this will lower their approval of you, making them unhappier.

You can opt to have your colony tax rates controlled automatically (the default setting). In this case the rate will be set at an appropriate level for the size and development of the colony. See the section 'Colonies and Tax Rates' in the Empire Policy screen (P key).

You can also decide whether to automate control of taxes on a per-colony basis by using the Colony Automation settings. To do this, select one of your colonies and click the 'Set Colony Automation' button under the Selection Panel. Then click the 'Automate Tax Rates' button to toggle how tax rates are handled for that colony.

[H3]Taxes and Colony Growth[/H3]
When a colony is first established the tax rate is usually very low. This makes the colony’s population happier and encourages faster growth.

As a colony grows in size and development, the tax rate can be increased and you can start earning decent tax income from the colony.

[H3]Corruption[/H3]
As your colony grows an unavoidable level of corruption will also creep in. Corruption reduces the overall private revenue generated by the colony, and thus also reduces how much tax you collect.

Some types of government can reduce corruption at colonies: Republic, Technocracy and Hive Mind.

Other governments increase corruption: Mercantile Guilds, Feudalism, Monarchy and Military Dictatorship.

Planetary Administration facilities can also reduce losses from corruption.
