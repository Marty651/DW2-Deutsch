GREETING_INTRODUCTION   ;We are the {0}.\n\nWe seek total dominance over all.\n\nWill you bow before us, or must you be conquered?
GREETING_FRIENDLY   ;What scheme for conquest have you come to share with us, friend?

GREETING_ANGRY    ;You come to speak with us, enemy?\n\nWhat pacifying offer do you have for us?


OFFER_DEAL    ;Would you accept this trade?
OFFER_DEAL_RESPONSE  ;What kind of deal are you offering?

PIRATEPROTECTION_DEAL    ;Space is a cold and dangerous place. It would be a such a shame if any of your ships or bases suffered harm...\n\nFor the small monthly fee of {0} credits we can guarantee that none of your ships will suffer any 'unfortunate accidents'.\n\nAt least, not until our next fee is due anyway...

DEAL_BEGIN    ;A deal? Let's hear it
DEAL_ACCEPT    ;We accept your proposal
DEAL_ACCEPT_RESPONSE  ;An excellent outcome!

SWAP_MAPS  ;What kind of map did you want to swap?

WAR_END_ACCEPT    ;For once we agree with you - this war should end.\n\nOur forces are standing down
WAR_END_REJECT    ;End the war?!\n\nOnly the weak crave relief from their losses. The strong press forward with conquest. You are the weak, and we are the strong.\n\nThis war is not over yet

PROTECTION_ACCEPT  ;We accept your request for protection. The monthly fee is {0} credits
PROTECTION_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL  ;We accept your request for protection. The monthly fee is {0} credits
PROTECTION_ACCEPT_ANGRY  ;Your pathetic weakness has been noted. Our 'protection' will cost you {0} credits per month. You may go now
PROTECTION_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY  ;We accept your request for protection. The monthly fee is {0} credits
PROTECTION_REJECT   ;No, we are not interested in protecting you
PROTECTION_REJECT_NEUTRAL  ;No, we don't want a Protection Arrangement with you
PROTECTION_REJECT_ANGRY  ;No, we don't want to protect your worthless empire! Perhaps we will conquer it instead...
PROTECTION_REJECT_FRIENDLY  ;No, we don't want a Protection Arrangement with you

CANCELTREATY    ;Our {0} with you is now terminated.\n\n"Terminated" - how we love that word! It has such a ring to it, don't you think?
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY  ;We used to like you.\n\nBut perhaps we misjudged matters...
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL  ;Very well then. Your insult has been noted
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_ANGRY  ;Good, good. This treaty was getting in the way of our plans anyway

CANCELPROTECTION_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY  ;A surprising choice. But perhaps it is for the best
CANCELPROTECTION_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL  ;What a shame. We will miss those monthly credits. Perhaps we will find other ways to obtain them...
CANCELPROTECTION_RESPONSE_ANGRY  ;Fool! Do you really think you can possibly survive without our 'protection'?!

TREATY_PROPOSAL    ;What exactly are you proposing?
TREATY_ACCEPTRESPONSE   ;Excellent!\n\nWe hope that you are compliant and submissive allies. Are you?
TREATY_REJECTRESPONSE   ;How independent of you.\n\nThat is not a trait that we like

PROTECTION_ACCEPTRESPONSE  ;A shrewd choice! We look forward to your monthly payments
PROTECTION_REJECTRESPONSE  ;What a foolish choice! You will end up paying for this...

GIFT_GIVE    ;We have a gift for you of {0} credits.\n\nIt is not in our nature to be so kind.\n\nSo you would be wise to see this as a cynical ploy
GIFT_THANKS_ANGRY    ;Your stingy gift has been recorded
GIFT_THANKS_NEUTRAL    ;Thank you for your modest gift
GIFT_THANKS_FRIENDLY    ;We are delighted to receive your very satisfactory gift!
GIFT_PROPOSE    ;What kind of gift did you have in mind?

WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_ANGRY  ;How ironic - we were just about to declare war on you! So convenient.\n\nAnd now you must die...
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL  ;How brave of you - daring to take us on!\n\nOf course, bravery and foolishness are closely related.\n\nVery closely, in this case
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY  ;You are full of surprises!\n\nBut we always welcome a good fight.\n\nSo victory to the strong! - that's us, of course
