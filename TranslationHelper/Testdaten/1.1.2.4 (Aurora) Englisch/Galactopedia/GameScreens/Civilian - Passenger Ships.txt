This screen lists all of the passenger ships in your empire.

Passenger ships are part of your civilian economy, so you cannot assign missions to them. Instead they seek out their own missions, transporting tourists and migrants between locations.

Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. You can filter by the type of passengers being transported: tourists or migrants.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the passenger ships are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the ship's current mission. It also shows any passengers that the ship is carrying.
