The Build Order screen provides a quick way to build a large number of ships. Each row lists a single ship role along with an amount field. Change the amount to build in the numeric field. You can also select the specific design to build for each role from the dropdown list in the center of each row.

Once you have set the amount and design you want to build for each role, click the Purchase button at the top of the panel to buy the new ships and begin construction. The new ships will be built at the best available construction yard in your empire. Often this means using multiple construction yards spread throughout your empire.

If you click on a role row you can then specify the amount and build location of each new ship by left-clicking on the yellow construction yard badges shown at the galaxy level.

Left-clicking once on a construction yard badge will queue construction of a single ship for that role at that location. Right-clicking on the badge will remove construction of a single ship for that role at that location.
