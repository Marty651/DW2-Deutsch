Ships and bases cost your empire in two ways:
[ULI]One-off initial purchase cost[/ULI]
[ULI]Ongoing annual maintenance costs[/ULI]

You should plan your needs carefully when purchasing new ships.

The purchase and maintenance costs for ships and bases are both largely determined by the current price for the resources required to build the ship or base. Thus in simple terms:

Ship Purchase Cost = Resources Required x Current Resource Prices

[H3]Resource prices[/H3]
Resource prices are determined on the open market based on supply and demand.

Thus when a resource is in high demand across the galaxy but with low supply its price will dramatically increase. Conversely a resource with high supply across the galaxy and relatively low demand will be inexpensive.

When you provide supplies of resources through your spaceports and mining stations you help to bring down the price of resources throughout the galaxy. This benefits your empire because it lowers ship purchase and maintenance costs. It also provides the same benefits for other empires.

[H3]Lowering ship maintenance costs[/H3]
Ship maintenance is a major expense for your empire. Thus you should make every effort to lower these costs. Some effective mechanisms for lowering ship maintenance costs are:
[ULI]Ensure that you have plentiful supplies of construction resources from your colonies and mining stations[/ULI]
[ULI]Fully research Command Center technology. Higher level command center components lower maintenance costs for your ships and bases[/ULI]
[ULI]Use a government type that has lower ship maintenance costs: Feudalism, Monarchy, Military Dictatorship, Hive Mind and Mercantile Guild governments all have lower costs[/ULI]
[ULI]Pick an alien race that has lower natural ship maintenance costs: Ackdarian and Haakonish races have lower costs[/ULI]
[ULI]Absorb a lot of one of the above races into your empire by colonization or conquest[/ULI]
