Any Admiral or General characters in your empire are shown in this list.

You can see the details of each character by hovering over the list entry and clicking to lock open the panel at the right.

You can change a character's name by clicking on their name under the portrait and typing a new one.

[H3]Admiral and General Locations[/H3]
Admirals apply their combat bonuses when they are onboard a military ship, and especially when they are in a fleet. You should use the location dropdown list and the 'Transfer' button to assign them to a particular fleet or other location.

Admirals can also provide non-combat bonuses when stationed at spaceports, e.g. ship construction speed.

Generals apply their ground combat bonuses when they are at a colony: either defending one of your own colonies or invading an enemy colony. You should use the location dropdown list and the 'Transfer' button to assign them to a particular fleet or colony.

To use a General defensively you should place them at one of your colonies. To use them for attacking you should place them in one of your Invasion fleets.

Generals can also provide non-combat bonuses when stationed at colonies, e.g. troop recruitment rate.

Alternatively you can automate the admiral or general so that your military advisors will select the best location for them. Use the 'Automate' button under the character portrait at the right.

[H3]Events[/H3]
At the very bottom of the detail panel is a list of all the events that the admiral or general has been involved with. Various events can improve or decrease their skills, or provide new character traits.
