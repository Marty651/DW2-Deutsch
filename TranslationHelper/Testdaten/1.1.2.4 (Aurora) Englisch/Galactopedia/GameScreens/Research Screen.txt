The Research screen shows all of the research projects.

Projects must be researched to unlock their benefits. Researching takes time. The speed of research is determined by the research output from your colonies and research stations.

Research projects provide the following types of new tech that can improve your empire in various ways:
[ULI]new ship hulls and components allow you to build bigger and better ships and bases[/ULI]
[ULI]new planetary facilities help improve your colonies[/ULI]
[ULI]improve your ability to colonize new worlds[/ULI]
[ULI]improve your ground troops[/ULI]
[ULI]provide various bonuses, including improving your diplomatic relations with other factions[/ULI]

The left side of the screen is the lowest tech level. These are the techs that you have at the start of a new game.

As you progress towards the right of the screen, the tech level increases. 

[H3]Order of Research[/H3]
Projects are linked together by paths. Parent projects must be researched before child projects. As you research one project, any child projects (usually to the right) are enabled for research.

[H3]Blind versus Non-Blind Research[/H3]
When your game has been setup to use blind research then you can only see the next available projects beyond those already researched.

When your game has been setup to see all research then you can see all of the projects from the start of the game.
