Your empire's characters are shown in this list. By default this is filtered to show non-spy character roles. Check the various other sort and filter options at the top of the panel.

You can see the details of each character by hovering over the list entry and clicking to lock open the panel at the right.

You can change a character's name by clicking on their name under the portrait and typing a new one.


[H3]Character Locations[/H3]
Most characters apply their skills to their current location. For example, an Admiral applies his military skills to the fleet he is part of. Scientists apply their research skills to the Research Station where they are based.

Your Leader applies his skills empire-wide, improving your whole empire in different ways. Conversely, when they have negative skill levels, they can be a detriment to your whole empire in those specific areas.

To move a character to a specific location use the location dropdown list to select the location and then click the 'Transfer' button to move them there.

If you want to completely automate where a character is located you can use the 'Automate' button under the character portrait at the right.

[H3]Events[/H3]
At the very bottom of the detail panel is a list of all the events that the character has been involved with. Various events can improve or decrease their skills, or provide new character traits.
