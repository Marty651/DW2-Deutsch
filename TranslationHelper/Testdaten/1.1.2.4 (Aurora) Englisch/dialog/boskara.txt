WAR_END_ACCEPT    ;For once we agree with you - this war should end.\n\nOur forces are standing down
WAR_END_REJECT    ;End the war?!\n\nOnly the weak crave relief from their losses. The strong press forward with conquest. You are the weak, and we are the strong.\n\nThis war is not over yet

TREATY_REJECTRESPONSE   ;How independent of you.\n\nThat is not a trait that we like

PROTECTION_ACCEPTRESPONSE  ;A shrewd choice! We look forward to your monthly payments
PROTECTION_REJECTRESPONSE  ;What a foolish choice! You will end up paying for this...

GIFT_THANKS_NEUTRAL    ;Thank you for your modest gift
GIFT_THANKS_FRIENDLY    ;We are delighted to receive your very satisfactory gift!
GIFT_PROPOSE    ;What kind of gift did you have in mind?

WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_ANGRY  ;How ironic - we were just about to declare war on you! So convenient.\n\nAnd now you must die...
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL  ;How brave of you - daring to take us on!\n\nOf course, bravery and foolishness are closely related.\n\nVery closely, in this case
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY  ;You are full of surprises!\n\nBut we always welcome a good fight.\n\nSo victory to the strong! - that's us, of course
