Galactic Wonders are great projects that you construct at your colonies. They provide unique bonuses to the colony, or even to your entire empire.

[H3]Wonders are Unique[/H3]
For some wonders, only one of them can be built in the galaxy. The first empire to complete the wonder obtains its benefits - any other incomplete wonders of the same type are cancelled.

Other wonders can only be built once in each empire.

Wonders are a special type of planetary facility, and so they work in a similar way to facilities.

Before you can build a wonder you must first research it. Wonders cost money to build, and they also have ongoing maintenance costs.

Some wonders are unique to a particular alien race - it can only be built by them. These wonders may also be related to race-specific game victory conditions.

Some wonders are also considered to be scenic locations, and thus will attract tourism to any colony that has them.

[H3]Building and viewing Wonders[/H3]
You can build wonders at a colony by selecting the colony in the Selection Panel and then clicking the green 'Build facilities' button. This will open a set of buttons with all of the planetary facilities that can be built at the colony, including any wonders.

You can see all of the facilities in your empire, including any wonders, in the Planetary Facilities list (Colonies section).

For details on each wonder refer to the individual topics in the Planetary Facilities section.
