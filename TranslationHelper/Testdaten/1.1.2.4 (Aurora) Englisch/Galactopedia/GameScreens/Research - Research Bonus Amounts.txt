This screen lists all of the research bonuses in your empire split out by type. Research bonuses are important in two ways:
[ULI]research speed is increased for projects with the matching bonus type, e.g. researching new Ship Hulls is accelerated when you have construction research bonuses[/ULI]
[ULI]some research projects have extra requirements where they can only be initiated when you have sufficient research bonuses of a particular type, e.g. some high-end Shield projects require you to have a certain threshold of Shield research bonuses[/ULI]

Hovering over each research bonus type displays a complete breakdown of all the sources for the bonus in a panel at the right.

These sources can include locations where you have built a research station. They can also include scientists and other characters. Other sources might be race or government bonuses.
