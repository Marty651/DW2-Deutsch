Some locations are dangerous because they have known hostile threats. These threats usually include mobile targets like pirate ships and deadly space creatures. These threats often move between locations, so this information is transitory and is updated often.

Civilian ships will not travel to a location which has hostile threats present. This means that construction ships will not build bases there. Exploration ships will not explore further there. It also means that mining ships will not mine there, nor will freighters pick up or deliver cargo from there.

[H3]Dangerous Locations List[/H3]
This screen lists dangerous locations that have known hostile threats. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. You can filter by each threat type, including specific types of space creature.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the dangerous locations are highlighted on the map. System and Location badges also indicate dangerous location using the red lightning bolt icon. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it's location. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the major threat at the location along with the total hostile strength. It also indicates when this information was last updated, and thus how accurate it is.

[H3]Queuing Investigation[/H3]
The button at the right allows you to queue an investigation and clearance of the dangerous location. When the next appropriate fleet becomes available it will move to the location and clear out any threats it finds there. You can click the button again to cancel the investigation.

If you cannot investigate the location the Queue button will be disabled. A tooltip on the button will explain why you cannot investigate.
