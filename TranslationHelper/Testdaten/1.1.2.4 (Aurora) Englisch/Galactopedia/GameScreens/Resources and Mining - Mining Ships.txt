Mining Ships are mobile resource extraction ships. They travel to mining locations to mine resources there. Once they have a full load they then return the extracted resources to the nearest spaceport.

Mining Ships are part of your civilian economy, so you cannot normally assign missions to them. Instead they seek out mining locations on their own, preferring resources that are in high demand in your empire.

However some government styles allow you to directly assign missions to Mining Ships. You can then choose where each mining ship will mine by selecting it and right-clicking on the target mining location.

This screen lists all of the Mining Ships in your empire. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. You can filter by the types of resources that are being mined: fuel, construction or luxury resources.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the mining ships are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the resources that the mining ship is extracting and the current mission.
