Corruption is the loss of wealth due to fraud, crime and inefficiency. Corruption affects your colonies, reducing the revenue you receive from them.

Smaller empires have relatively low corruption, but as your empire's population grows, corruption grows along with it. Also, the further your colonies are from your capital, the more corruption exists.

Planetary Administration facilities also improve happiness and development at your colonies.
