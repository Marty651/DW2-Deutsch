Troops are used to invade enemy colonies and to defend your colonies against invasion.

Troop units are recruited at your colonies and take time to reach operational readiness. Larger colonies can train and recover troops faster than smaller colonies.

New troop units can be unlocked through research. Higher level troop units can only be recruited when the required planetary facility is built at a colony.

Troops can be garrisoned at colonies. This means that they are permanently stationed at the colony to defend it, and thus will not be picked up by Troop Transport ships.

Troop units have a one-off monetary cost to recruit. They also have ongoing annual maintenance costs.

Each troop also has a size: some are small (Infantry) whereas others are larger (Armored, Planetary Defense). Size is important when considering troop carrying capacity for Troop Transport ships and Invasion fleets.

[H3]Troop Unit Types[/H3]
There are 5 types of Troop units:
[ULI]Infantry: the basic defensive troop unit. Infantry are available from the start of the game. Each race has it's own unique infantry unit with various strengths and weaknesses[/ULI]
[ULI]Armored: the primary attack troop unit. Requires an Armor Barracks facility to recruit[/ULI]
[ULI]Planetary Defense: specialized defensive troop units that can intercept enemy troops as they travel from their landing ships to the planetary surface. Requires a Planetary Defense Center facility to recruit[/ULI]
[ULI]Special Forces: highly-trained infantry units that specialize in taking out colony defenses during an invasion (ground facilities, defending planetary defense units, enemy generals). Defending Special Forces focus on eliminating invading Special Forces unitsRequires a Special Operations Barracks facility to recruit[/ULI]
[ULI]Titans: very strong high-end attack units. Requires a Titan Manufacturing Center facility to recruit[/ULI]

[H3]Troops List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the troop units in your empire. Check the extensive sort and filter options at the top of the panel. You can sort by attack and defend strength, maintenance cost and location. You can filter by troop type, garrison status and location (colonies vs transports).

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the troops are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the attack strength, defend strength and maintenance cost for the troop unit. Hovering over a list item displays a detailed summary in a panel at the right. Garrisoned troops are indicated by a blue line underneath their image.
