Construction of ships and bases is a core aspect of Distant Worlds. Understanding the details of construction will help you to expand your empire more effectively.

All construction costs money – you must have sufficient funds to buy new ships and bases.

As your technology level increases your construction abilities grow. Research unlocks new, larger Hulls that can be used to design and build new ships and bases.

Construction of ships for your private economy happens automatically – your private citizens purchase and build freighters and mining ships as needed.

[H3]Where construction happens[/H3]
Ship or base building takes place at three types of locations:
[ULI]Colonies: can build any kind of ship, but at a relatively slow rate compared to spaceports[/ULI]
[ULI]Spaceports: the key location for building most ships (military ships, exploration ships, freighters, mining ships)[/ULI]
[ULI]Construction Ships: for building mining stations, research stations and other bases at non-colony locations[/ULI]

[H3]How to initiate construction[/H3]
To initiate state construction you have four options:
[ULI]select a colony or spaceport and click the yellow button 'Build new ship or base' under the Selection Panel. The buttons will change to show all buildable items for that construction yard. Hover each button to see the type and cost for each new ship. Click a button to build an item[/ULI]
[ULI]select a construction ship, find a build location for a new base, and right-click to show a pop-up menu with a 'Build' menu option for the bases that can be built at this location. Click the desired 'Build Base' menu option[/ULI]
[ULI]open the Build Order screen (in Construction section of Control Center) and select the designs and amounts for each ship role, then click the Purchase button[/ULI]
[ULI]use the 'Queue New Base' buttons in any of the New Location lists, e.g. New Mining Locations (shift-F7) or New Research Locations (shift-F9)[/ULI]

Note that after construction, ships start off fully automated. To take control of one of your state-owned ships simply assign a mission to it.
