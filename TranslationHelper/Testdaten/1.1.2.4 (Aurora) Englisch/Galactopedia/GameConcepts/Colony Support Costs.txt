All colonies cost money to support. When colonies are small and undeveloped they are a net drain on your economy, because their support costs are high and typically eclipse their revenue.

[H3]Reduction as Colony Grows[/H3]
Support costs drop as the population of a colony grows.

As colonies grow their tax revenue will also eventually exceed their support costs. At this point the colony becomes revenue positive: their income exceeds their costs.

These well-developed colonies can then provide funding for your empire.

[H3]Very Large Colonies[/H3]
As colonies grow even larger (above 50% maximum population) their support costs again begin to rise.

However at this point the revenue from these large colonies is usually very high, offsetting these losses.

[H3]Support Cost Factors[/H3]
In summary, the following factors increase colony support costs:
[ULI]population less than 100 million[/ULI]
[ULI]suitability for population less than 20[/ULI]
[ULI]unassimilated population[/ULI]
[ULI]population above 50% of maximum[/ULI]
