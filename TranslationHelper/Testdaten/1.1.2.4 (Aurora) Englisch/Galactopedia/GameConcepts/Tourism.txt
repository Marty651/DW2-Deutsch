Tourism involves transporting vacationing passengers from colonies to resort bases.

These tourists are transported to their destination by privately-owned passenger ships. Tourism occurs entirely in the private sector of your empire - you have no control over the movement of tourists.

Tourism can be a significant source of bonus income for your empire.

[H3]Scenic Locations and Resorts[/H3]
Resort bases are special bases built at scenic locations throughout the galaxy. Scenic locations can include the following:
[ULI]Ringed planets[/ULI]
[ULI]Black Holes[/ULI]
[ULI]Neutron stars[/ULI]
[ULI]Planets with unusual ruins or ancient monuments[/ULI]
[ULI]Colonies with Wonders[/ULI]
[ULI]Planets or moons with spectacular natural features[/ULI]

[H3]Scenery Bonuses[/H3]
Scenic locations will have a Scenery bonus. This defines the amount and source of the scenic feature, for example: '+10% from Vast Underwater Tunnel Network'.

To see any scenery bonuses for a star, planet, moon or asteroid:
[OLI]select the location[/OLI]
[OLI]in the Selection Panel, hover the 'Location Bonuses' area[/OLI]
[OLI]a tooltip will display all of the bonuses at the location, including any scenery bonuses[/OLI]

You can find unused scenic locations in the 'New Resort Locations' list in the Civilian section of the Control Center. Use the 'Build Resort Base' buttons at the right to queue the construction of new Resort Bases at your desired locations.

Note that colonies with scenery bonuses will attract tourism without the need to build a resort base at the colony.

The volume of tourists that a resort attracts depends on how scenic the location is, and how close it is to large, wealthy colonies. The wealthy citizens of these kinds of colonies are on the lookout for scenic tourism destinations to travel to.

[H3]Income from Tourism[/H3]
Income is derived when passenger ships arrive at a resort. The amount of income depends on how many passengers the ship was carrying. This variable income is shown in the Economy screen (F2) under the line item 'Tourism' in the section 'Annual Bonus Income'.

Tourism also occurs across empire boundaries (as long as relations between two empires are not war). So passenger ships can transport visitors from the colony of one empire to the Resort Base of another empire.
