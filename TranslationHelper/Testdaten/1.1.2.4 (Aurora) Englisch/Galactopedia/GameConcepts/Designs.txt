All of the ships and bases in your empire use designs. Designs are templates or blueprints for building a ship or base.

[H3]Ship Hulls[/H3]
Ship Hulls are the superstructure of a ship or base. Each hull has a role, e.g. Small Freighter, Mining Station, Frigate.

Hulls have an intrinsic size (the size of the hull itself) and a maximum size which defines the largest design you can make with the hull, including all of the components added to the hull.

They can sometimes have a built-in reactive armor level. This means that some hulls are better able to resist enemy weapons fire, even without armor components being added to the design.

Hulls also require resources to build.

[H3]Component Bays[/H3]
Hulls contain component bays - spaces that house components of various types in the design.

There are 6 types of component bays. Each bay type only allows certain types of components:
[ULI]General: command centers, crew quarters, fuel cells, reactors, hyperdrives, cargo bays, passenger compartments, troop compartments, mining engines, energy collectors and all others[/ULI]
[ULI]Weapons: weapons or tractor beams[/ULI]
[ULI]Engines: engines and vectoring engines[/ULI]
[ULI]Defense: armor, shields or damage control[/ULI]
[ULI]Hangars: docking bays, construction yards or fighter bays[/ULI]
[ULI]Sensors: scanners, countermeasures, targeting computers, survey modules, scanner jammers[/ULI]

Each component bay also has a maximum size. Components that are larger than this size cannot fit in the bay.

[H3]Components[/H3]
Designs are made by adding a set of components that provide all of the functionality required for the particular type of ship or base. The components are added to specific bays in the hull, as outlined above.

Some types of components are always present in all designs: e.g. reactors, fuel storage, crew quarters and command centers are always required for any type of ship or base.

Other component types are more specialized, e.g. construction yards, research labs, docking bays.

As your research progresses you unlock improvements to existing components in your ships and bases. These improvements will automatically enhance the capabilities of your ships and bases.

Sometimes research breakthroughs may provide completely new components. As these new advanced components become available you should upgrade your designs to use them.
