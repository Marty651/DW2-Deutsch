Fleets allow you to group a number of military ships together and assign missions to the entire group. This is useful for coordinating large attacks on enemy targets.

They have a home base that defines their center of operations. They also have an engagement range that defines the area they will engage enemy targets, in a radius out from their home base.

Your automated fleets will respond to intercept enemy attacks when there are insufficient forces to defend the target. The nearest available automated fleet will travel to the attack location and defend the target.

There are five types of fleets:
[ULI]Attack: large fleets for major assaults against enemy targets like colonies or spaceports[/ULI]
[ULI]Defense: used to guard important locations, and respond to enemy attacks within range[/ULI]
[ULI]Raid: smaller fleets used to attack smaller targets like bases and other small fleets[/ULI]
[ULI]Invasion: used to land lots of troops when invading enemy colonies[/ULI]
[ULI]Manual: manually controlled fleet[/ULI]

[H3]Creating New Fleets[/H3]
You can create a new fleet in a number of different ways:
[ULI]select multiple military ships in the main view by drag-selecting with the left mouse button held down or by ctrl-clicking each ship. Then click the 'Create New Fleet' button under the Selection Panel[/ULI]
[ULI]select multiple ships in the Military Ships list by ctrl- and shift-clicking ships in the list. Then click the 'Create New Fleet' button under the Selection Panel[/ULI]
[ULI]in the Fleet Templates screen, select the desired template and then click either the 'Form new fleet' or 'Build new fleet' buttons at the right[/ULI]

You can also add individual ships to an existing fleet by selecting the ship and clicking the 'Join ship to fleet' button under the Selection Panel. This will popup a list of all fleets that can be joined. Select the fleet you want the ship to join by clicking on it from the list.

[H3]Tactical Settings[/H3]
Fleets have a full array of tactical settings that fine-tune how they operate. Open the tactical settings screen by selecting the fleet and clicking the 'Set Tactics' button at the far-right under the Selection Panel.

Note that individual ships within a fleet also have their own tactical settings. You can tweak how the fleet and ship tactics interact in the section 'Fleet Ships - Tactical Overrides'.

[H3]Fleet Engagement Range[/H3]
Engagement Range is a very important fleet tactical setting. Using this you can control how far fleets will respond to threats.

Defense fleets will defend their home base and also respond to enemy attacks against any of our colonies or bases within its Engagement Range.

Attack, Raid and Invasion fleets will attack their attack point and then any other enemy target within their Engagement Range. They will also respond to any threats or dangerous locations within the Engagement Range from their home base.

[H3]Selecting fleets[/H3]
There are four ways to select a fleet:
[ULI]when zoomed out to system-level or greater your fleets appear as an large triangular icon with striped edges. Click the fleet icon to select it[/ULI]
[ULI]when zoomed in to location-level, you can double-click any ship in the fleet to select the entire fleet[/ULI]
[ULI]using the Control Center, open the Fleets list (shift-F11) and click the desired fleet[/ULI]
[ULI]cycle all of your fleets by repeatedly pressing the F key[/ULI]

When a fleet is selected you can assign missions to it in the same way you would assign missions to a single ship.

[H3]Setting a Home Base[/H3]
A fleet's home base is their center of operations. They will return here when they are not carrying out a mission.

The home base should have sufficient fuel for the entire fleet. Good candidates are spaceports, large colonies, or a fuel mining station. When you select a new fleet home base, stock levels will automatically order more fuel at the location.

To set a fleet’s home base:
[OLI]select the fleet[/OLI]
[OLI]right-click and hold on the location of the new home base, which will popup a menu[/OLI]
[OLI]click the menu option 'Set home base for (Fleet Name) to (Location)'[/OLI]

[H3]Setting an Attack Point[/H3]
Fleet attack points are the initial attack targets when a war begins with another empire.

This allows you to predefine your war attack plan, pre-positioning your fleets prior to the commencement of hostilities. When the war begins, your fleets will automatically head towards their attack points.

To set a fleet attack point:
[OLI]select the fleet[/OLI]
[OLI]right-click and hold on the location for the attack point (should be a foreign base or colony), which will popup a menu[/OLI]
[OLI]click the menu option 'Set attack point for (Fleet Name) to (Location)'[/OLI]
