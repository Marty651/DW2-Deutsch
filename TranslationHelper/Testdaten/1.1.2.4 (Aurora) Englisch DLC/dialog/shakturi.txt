GREETING_INTRODUCTION		;We are the {0}.\n\nWe are peaceful wanderers who seek harmony and goodwill with all.
GREETING_FRIENDLY			;What evil scheme have you come to share with us, friend?
GREETING_NEUTRAL			;Explain your presence before us
GREETING_ANGRY				;You come to speak with us, enemy?\n\nWhat do you have to say?

OFFER_FREETRADE				;Will you submit to a Free Trade Agreement with us?\n\nBoth of our economies will benefit greatly. And we can also size you up for later conquest.\n\nWhat do you say?
FREETRADE_ACCEPT			;A Free Trade Agreement would be very useful. We accept
FREETRADE_REJECT			;No, we are not interested in a Free Trade Agreement.\n\nWe have other plans for you...

CANCELTREATY						;Our {0} with you is now terminated.\n\nThis arrangement no longer has any use to us
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;We used to like you.\n\nBut perhaps we misjudged matters...
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;Very well then. Your insult has been noted
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_ANGRY			;Good, good. This treaty was getting in the way of our plans anyway

TREATY_PROPOSAL					;What exactly are you proposing?
TREATY_ACCEPTRESPONSE			;Excellent!\n\nWe hope that you are compliant and submissive allies. Are you?
TREATY_REJECTRESPONSE			;How independent of you.\n\nThat is not a trait that we like

TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE			;The time has arrived to soften you up: we are imposing Trade Sanctions on you!\n\nDo not bother replying; we are not interested in your response
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_ANGRY	;We seethe with fury at you!\n\nDo not think that you are strong enough to challenge us - you are not
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL	;If we cared about this, we might be angry.\n\nBut we do not, so we are not
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_SURPRISED	;We admit that your action has surprised us.\n\nBut thank you for identifying yourself as an enemy for us.\n\nBe assured that we will deal with you when we are ready...
TRADESANCTIONS_LIFT			;We're lifting our Trade Sanctions against you.\n\nYou appear to have become much more compliant. Lesson learned for you
TRADESANCTIONS_LIFT_RESPONSE		;This seems to matter greatly to you.\n\nBut not to us

WAR_DECLARE				;Your turn has come to be assimilated into our mighty empire: we declare WAR on you!\n\nYour conquest will be swift and total.\n\nPlease do not beg for mercy - we have none
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_EAGER		;How ironic - we were just about to declare war on you! So convenient.\n\nAnd now you must die...
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;How brave of you - daring to take us on!\n\nOf course, bravery and foolishness are closely related.\n\nVery closely, in this case
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_SURPRISED		;You are full of surprises!\n\nBut we always welcome a good fight.\n\nSo victory to the strong! - that's us, of course

WAR_END					;It is time for this war to end. We will complete your assimilation later.\n\nWhat do you say?
WAR_END_ACCEPT				;For once we agree with you - this war should end.\n\nOur forces are standing down
WAR_END_REJECT				;End the war?!\n\nOnly the weak crave relief from their losses. The strong press forward with conquest. You are the weak, and we are the strong.\n\nThis war is not over yet

GIFT_GIVE				;We have a gift for you of {0} credits.\n\nIt is not in our nature to be so kind.\n\nSo you would be wise to see this as a cynical ploy
GIFT_THANKS				;Thank you for your gift.\n\nIt reminds us of a conquered enemy paying tribute to us

WARNING						;You want to warn us?\n\nGo ahead and waste your words on us
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS			;We know of your covert missions against us.\n\nBe warned that we can give you a lesson in treachery that you will never forget...\n\nStop your missions now, while you still can
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY	;Convert missions against you? How shocking
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL	;Don't worry. That's just our routine surveillance on your empire.\n\nNothing sinister to be concerned about
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_ANGRY	;Convert missions? That would typically indicate preparations for war.\n\nBut surely that is not the case here. So don't worry about it...
WARNING_ATTACKS					;Stop your blatant attacks on our ships and bases!\n\nThese actions put you on very dangerous ground. We warn you to stop now
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;Attacks on you? We are so upset about this
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;Attacks on YOU?!\n\nNo, no - our ships were defending themselves from attacks by your forces.\n\nPlease don't do that again
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_ANGRY			;Attacks?\n\nYes, we are softening you up prior to launching an all-out assault.\n\nAnything else you'd like to discuss?
