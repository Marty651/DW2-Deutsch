Characters are the people in the galaxy that rule empires, conduct diplomacy, command fleets, lead troops in battle, perform scientific research, design new technology and carry out espionage missions.

Each character has skills and traits that determine their strengths and weaknesses. Through their experiences and actions characters can acquire new skills and traits (both positive and negative), and also increase the level of their skills.

Some characters initially have their traits and skill levels hidden. These will not be revealed until they are actually given a mission or other responsibility that uses those skills. These characters are considered “Untested”.

Character skills provide bonuses specific to the character’s role. Some examples:
[ULI]Your empire Leader provides bonuses to your entire empire[/ULI]
[ULI]Ambassadors provide bonuses to diplomatic relations with the foreign empire where they serve as ambassador[/ULI]
[ULI]Fleet Admirals provide bonuses to all the ships in their fleet[/ULI]
[ULI]Troop Generals provide bonuses to the troops they lead in battle at a colony[/ULI]
[ULI]Scientists provide bonuses to the research station where they are[/ULI]
[ULI]Spies use their various espionage-related skills to perform different types of intelligence missions[/ULI]

[H3]How character skills apply to a Location[/H3]
As outlined above, some characters provide bonuses to their current location, e.g. admirals provide ship bonuses to their fleet, scientists provide research bonuses to their research station.

When there are multiple characters at the same location (colony, ship, base or fleet) then their skills do not stack linearly. Instead subsequent characters apply their skills in a diminishing manner.

Thus the best character skill for an area applies at 100% of it's value, but the next strongest character for that skill only applies 50% of their skill level for that area. The third strongest character then applies only 25% of their skill level for that area. Each subsequent character at the location halves the amount of their skill that is added to the total for that skill area.

This means that is is often better to spread characters across multiple locations instead of concentrating them at a single location, e.g. have admirals and generals in multiple fleets, have scientists at multiple research stations, etc.

[H2]Character Types[/H2]
[H3]Leaders[/H3]
Your empire always has a leader. Your leaders skills and traits affect your entire empire.

Different government types have different ways of replacing leaders. Elected governments will generally hold elections and replace leaders peacefully.  Unelected governments replace leaders less often, but when change happens it can be quite disruptive.

The bonuses generated by Leaders apply to your entire empire. Leaders are assigned to your Homeworld and are much less effective if not stationed at your capital.

Pirate factions have special Pirate Leaders. These characters combine the skills and traits of both Leaders and Fleet Admirals. Some Pirate Leaders will be better at leadership while others may be better as admirals. Pirate Leaders are usually based at the faction's pirate base.

[H3]Ambassadors[/H3]
Ambassadors are skilled Diplomats that can help you keep your enemies calm and develop friends into full allies.

In order to influence an alien faction with an Ambassador, you must discover the home world of that faction and then assign the Ambassador to that location.

[H3]Scientists[/H3]
These characters can boost your Research output at a single Spaceport or Research Station. Assign them to a Spaceport or Research Station to see their effects.

[H3]Fleet Admirals[/H3]
These characters affect all the ships in a single fleet. Assign them to a Fleet to see their effects.

[H3]Troop Generals[/H3]
These characters affect all troops at a colony or loaded onto a fleet. Assign them to a Fleet or a colony to see their effects.

[H3]Spies[/H3]
These characters have a variety of special missions. By default, they are assigned to Counter-Intelligence, which helps protect your empire against enemy spy missions. See the topic 'Intelligence Missions' for more information.

[H3]Character Survival[/H3]
Characters can retire or perish due to a variety of causes. Keep your most valuable characters safe by making sure that they and the locations where they are assigned are protected from harm.

Characters may also be dismissed by using the Dismiss button on the Character Screen, but it may be some time before another character of the same type is generated. In most cases, it’s worth trying to develop the characters rather than dismissing them and hoping a more exceptional character comes along.

[H3]New Character Generation[/H3]
The player's actions influence what kind of new characters are most likely to be generated. Embarking on a major expansion of military ships is likely to generate a new Admiral. Similarly, convincing alien factions to sign new treaties may generate an Ambassador and a critical Research breakthrough may reveal a new Scientist.
