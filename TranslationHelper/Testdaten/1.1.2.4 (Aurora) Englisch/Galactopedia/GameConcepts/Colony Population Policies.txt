Population Policies provide control over which alien races you allow at your colonies.

These can be set in the Population Policy screen which pops out from the Selection Panel when one of your colonies is selected. Hover over the population policy icon at the far-right of the population row for the selected colony. Click the icon or the screen to lock it open.

Each race you have met is listed, allowing you to set specific policies for every alien race at each colony.

You can apply the settings for the current colony to all colonies in your empire by clicking the button 'Apply this policy to all colonies'.

The five different population policy settings are described below.

[H3]Assimilate[/H3]
Assimilate means to accept this race into your empire. This is the default setting.

[H3]Do Not Accept[/H3]
Do not allow migration of this race to the colony. This will prevent passenger ships from dropping off migrants from this race at the colony.

[H3]Resettle[/H3]
Actively migrate this race away from the colony to other colonies that will accept them. Passenger ships will pick up this race from the colony.

[H3]Enslave[/H3]
Enslaves this race, forcing them into hard labor. When a race is enslaved at a colony it’s growth rate will be zero.

For each race that you enslave, the corresponding empires of those races will take offense at your actions. The amount of offense is directly related to the population amount that you enslave.

Enslavement also provides a bonus to the colony's economy. The amount of the bonus depends on the proportion of the total population that is enslaved, up to a maximum of 50% if all of the population is enslaved.

Note that when a race is enslaved it will never be used to establish a new colony, even if it is the most suitable race in your empire for the planet.

[H3]Exterminate[/H3]
Steadily eliminates this race at the colony, reducing their population until it reaches zero. When a race is being exterminated at a colony it’s growth rate will be zero.

For each race that you are exterminating, the corresponding empires of those races will take deep offense at your actions. The amount of offense is directly related to the population amount that you exterminate.

Exterminating races will also negatively impact your empire's reputation – all other empire’s will be offended by your harsh actions.

Note that when a race is being exterminated it will never be used to establish a new colony, even if it is the most suitable race in your empire for the planet.
