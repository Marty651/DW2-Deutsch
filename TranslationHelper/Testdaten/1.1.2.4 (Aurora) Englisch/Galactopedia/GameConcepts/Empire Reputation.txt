Your empires reputation is how others view your empire. Your reputation is separate from any specific relationship with a single empire - it is a rating of how your past actions are viewed by ALL other empires.

Thus your reputation has an influence on your diplomacy with all other factions.

Your reputation also has a small impact on happiness at your colonies - a positive reputation will give a boost to happiness, whereas a negative reputation will decrease happiness.

[H3]Effect of Government on Reputation[/H3]
Some government types take particular notice of another empire's reputation, while other forms of government aren't so concerned about your reputation.

Generally Monarchies, Democracies, Republics and Feudalisms care a great deal about the reputations of other empires - they wonâ€™t usually form alliances with them unless they have a good reputation.

On the other hand Military Dictatorships and Hive Minds are not so high-minded - they will form alliances with practically anyone.

[H3]Factors that affect Reputation[/H3]
Factors that can impact your reputation include:
[ULI][GOOD]Honoring a Defense treaty[/GOOD] with another empire and declaring war on their enemy (when called upon by your partner) will have a positive impact on your reputation. Alternatively, [BAD]failing to honor such a treaty[/BAD] will have a negative affect on your reputation[/ULI]
[ULI][GOOD]Peacefully integrating an independent colony[/GOOD] through diplomacy and colonization will positively affect your reputation[/ULI]
[ULI][GOOD]Destroying pirates[/GOOD] will have a positive effect on your reputation[/ULI]
[ULI][GOOD]Destroying space creatures[/GOOD] will have a positive effect on your reputation[/ULI]
[ULI][WARN]Declaring war against another empire[/WARN] will have a slight negative impact on your reputation, especially if the war is unjustified[/ULI]
[ULI][BAD]Unprovoked attacks[/BAD] against other empires when not at war with them will have a negative impact on your reputation[/ULI]
[ULI][BAD]Intercepted intelligence missions[/BAD] against another empire will have a negative affect on your reputation[/ULI]
[ULI]Taking over an [BAD]independent colony by invasion[/BAD] (instead of colonization) will negatively affect your reputation[/ULI]
[ULI][BAD]Bombarding colonies[/BAD] will very negatively affect your reputation, unless the empire targetted by the bombardment has a very poor reputation. In this situation, other empires are not so concerned about bombardment - they feel that the targetted empire is getting what they deserve[/ULI]
[ULI]Using [BAD]Slavery or Extermination policies[/BAD] at your colonies will very negatively affect your reputation[/ULI]
[ULI]Destroying colonies with [BAD]planet destroyers[/BAD] will have an extremely powerful negative affect on your reputation. However, as with bombardment above, if the targetted empire has a very poor reputation then other empires will not be so concerned[/ULI]
