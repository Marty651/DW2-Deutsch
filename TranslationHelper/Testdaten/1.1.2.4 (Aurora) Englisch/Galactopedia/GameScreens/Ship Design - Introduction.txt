The Ship Design screen allows you to create a new design for a ship, base or fighter.

You generate a new design by adding components to the bays in a hull.

Your new design must meet many requirements to be considered valid. For example:
[ULI]all designs must have a command center[/ULI]
[ULI]all designs must store fuel to generate energy from a reactor[/ULI]
[ULI]all ships must have engines to be mobile[/ULI]

There are many more requirements specific to each role.

[H3]Recommendations Button[/H3]
Check the Recommendations button and popout panel as you add components to your design (at the top of the Design Summary panel). Some recommendations are optional (shown in yellow). Other recommendations are compulsory (shown in red).

You cannot save your design until all the requirements are met.
