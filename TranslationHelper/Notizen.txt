# Notes / TODO: 
# - Dad needs the other program first -> check glossar (component def. + names of galactopedia files) against the "flie√ütexte" (galactopedia)
# - Is not checking empty content really good?
# - Comment nodes instead of text nodes & show both (all) at the same time?
# - Out-Of-Scope FN variable usage !
# - .txt-Dateien (GameText.txt)
# - Optional rules (no invalid but "not found"?)
# - German Config
# - Use XDocument or XPathNavigator for Line Numbers?
