Colony Ships are special transport ships that can load huge numbers of colonists that are sent to a colonize a new world for your empire.

When colony ships reach their destination they are disassembled and the raw resources used in establishing the new colony. Thus colony ships can only be used to colonize a single world. You must build a new colony ship for each world you want to colonize.

[H3]Colony Ship List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the colony ships in your empire. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the colony ship locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the construction level, current mission and any loaded colonists onboard.

[H3]Automation Status[/H3]
You change the automation status of the colony ship using the button at the far-right of the list item.
