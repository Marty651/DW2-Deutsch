Pirates are outlaw factions that live entirely in space, on ships or bases. They have no colonies. Pirates are generally unfriendly and hostile. They raid and pillage, taking what they want.

However you can improve relations with pirates by accepting 'protection' agreements or offering them gifts. Alternatively you can simply build up your forces and wipe them out.

[H3]Pirate Faction List[/H3]
This screen lists all your relations with pirate factions. Check the various sort and filter options at the top of the panel.

Each list item shows how the pirate faction feels towards you along with the trend of your relationship.

Clicking a relation item in the list will select the faction pirate base, if known.

[H3]Relation Detail Panel[/H3]
Hovering over a list item shows the Relation detail panel to the right. Clicking the list item or the detail panel will lock it open.

The detail panel provides a complete summary of your relationship with the selected pirate faction, with similar information to what you would see when interacting with another empire.

Pirates often have much secret information about the galaxy which they may be willing to sell to you if relations are friendly enough.
