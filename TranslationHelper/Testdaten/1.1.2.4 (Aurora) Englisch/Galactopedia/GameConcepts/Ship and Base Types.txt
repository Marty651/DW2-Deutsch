[H2]Military Ships[/H2]
There are various types of military ships, as outlined below. Military ships often work well when formed together into fleets.

Cycle through all of your Military Ships using the M key, or Shift-M to cycle backwards.

[H3]Escort[/H3]
Escorts are the first type of military ship you can build. They are the smallest type of military ship, and are lightly armed.

Escorts can be used in early fleets, when no other types of military ship are available. But they are better suited to escorting civilian ships.

[H3]Frigate[/H3]
Frigates are fast and maneuverable military ships. They are often the most numerous type of military ship for an empire.

They are the smallest ship that is well-suited to fleet operations. As part of a fleet they typically serve as pickets, providing the first line of defence against enemy attackers.

[H3]Destroyer[/H3]
Destroyers are versatile military ships that can perform a number of tasks.

Destroyers often serve as long-range missile or torpedo attackers that stand-off from targets, firing deadly salvoes.

Some Destroyer hulls have hangar bays, allowing them to serve as small fighter carriers.

In large fleets Destroyers typically serve as close escorts, screening the larger capital ships from enemy attackers.

[H3]Cruiser[/H3]
Cruisers are large, well-armed warships.

With many weapon bays they have enough space to add extra weapon types, like Ion weapons and Bombard weapons.

Cruisers typically have multiple sensor bays, allowing long range scanners and other sensors.

They are thus able to serve as effective fleet flagships when there are no Battleships or Carriers available. 

Cruisers may also use hangar bays, allowing them to serve as small fighter carriers.

[H3]Battleship[/H3]
Battleships are the largest type of military ship. They are heavily armed and defended.

With many weapon bays they have enough space to add any weapon type, including Ion weapons, Bombard weapons, Area weapons and Tractor beams.

They may also utilize HyperDeny components to prevent escape of fleeing enemy ships.

Their multiple sensor bays are typically filled with long range scanners, fleet targeting, fleet countermeasures and jump tracking sensors.

They are thus the prime choice to serve as fleet flagships.

Battleships may also choose to have fighter bays, thus serving as a carrier.

[H3]Carrier[/H3]
Carriers are large warships designed to deploy large numbers of fighters. They may have weak weaponry, but compensate for this with their many fighter bays.

They work best in a fleet, being escorted by other military ships that can provide extra defense.

Carriers may also utilize HyperDeny components to prevent escape of fleeing enemy ships.

Their multiple sensor bays are typically filled with long range scanners, fleet targeting, fleet countermeasures and jump tracking sensors.

Carriers are thus a good choice to serve as fleet flagships.

[H3]Troop Transport[/H3]
Troop Transports are specialized ships that move troops between your colonies. They also deploy troops for invasion of enemy colonies.

They are heavily shielded and armored, but often carry only light weapons.

Troop Transports have 2 key components:
[ULI]Troop Compartments that house troops while onboard the ship[/ULI]
[ULI]Assault Pods that land the troops at the enemy colony[/ULI]

Troop Transports are usually part of a full invasion fleet that includes other ships to attack enemy defensive installations at target colonies.

[H3]Fuel Tanker[/H3]
Fuel Tankers replenish the fuel supplies of other ships.

They can mine fuel from a natural source or load fuel from a spaceport or colony. They then seek out ships that need refuelling and transfer fuel to them.

Fuel Tankers do not need to dock with other ships to resupply them. Instead their Remote Fuel Transfer component allows them to refuel any ship once they get close to it.

When Fuel Tankers are assigned to a fleet, they will focus their efforts on refuelling ships in their fleet.

This allows the fleet to have greater endurance, operating more effectively even when far from a friendly refuelling point.

[H2]Non-Military State-Owned Ships[/H2]
There are 3 types of non-military state-owned ships, as outlined below.

[H3]Exploration Ship[/H3]
Exploration ships chart unknown areas of the galaxy. As they explore they reveal colonizable planets, uncover valuable resources and make contact with other empires.

Early Exploration Ships may utilize Survey Modules that allow sending a survey party to unexplored locations. Surveying can be slow, but quite detailed.

Later tech allows Exploration Ships to be equipped with powerful resource detection sensors for discovering valuable minerals.

These resource scanners are faster than surveying. However surveying may still be useful to explore deeper when you detect locations with hidden items.

Cycle through all of your Exploration Ships using the X key, or Shift-X to cycle backwards.

[H3]Construction Ship[/H3]
Construction Ships are mobile construction yards.

These large ships spend most of their time building bases at uninhabited planets and moons. These bases can include mining stations, research stations, resort bases and monitoring stations.

They can also be used to repair any abandoned ships or bases that you encounter.

Before building a new base, Construction Ships must first load the resources required to build the base. So they will first travel to a spaceport to load the resources before heading to their build location.

Cycle through all of your Construction Ships using the U key, or Shift-U to cycle backwards.

[H3]Colony Ship[/H3]
Colony ships allow you to colonize other planets, founding new worlds for your empire.

The ship is consumed when a new colony is established. The resources from the ship are used to give the colony a kickstart.

Once a Colony Ship is built, it will load population from a nearby colony. These will serve as the colonists of the new world founded by the Colony Ship.

At the start of the game you can only colonize planets that are very suitable, usually the native planet type for your race.

But as your research uncovers new technology you can progressively colonize more planets that were previously unsuitable.

You can always colonize planets where there is an existing independent alien population, regardless of the type or suitability of the planet.

However in these situations the preexisting population will likely resist your colonization attempt, with the loss of your colony ship, and a black mark on your diplomatic reputation.

So before attempting to colonize an independent world you should first establish good relations with them by diplomatic gifts and trade treaties. Once they like you, your chance of colonization success will rise, and they may even invite you to colonize.

[H2]Civilian Ships[/H2]
Civilian ships belong to the private citizens in your empire. They automatically go about their work without any input from you.

[H3]Mining Ship[/H3]
Mining Ships are mobile resource extraction ships. They mine resources that are in high demand, returning them to your nearest space port.

Mining ships work for your empire, but they are not yours. They belong to the private citizens in your empire.

Thus you cannot assign missions to Mining ships.

[H3]Freighter[/H3]
Freighters transport cargo between colonies, mining stations and space ports. They come in small, medium and large sizes.

Freighters work for your empire, but they are not yours. They belong to the private citizens in your empire. All transportation of goods in your empire is performed by private citizens.

Thus you cannot assign missions to Freighters.

[H3]Passenger Ship[/H3]
Passenger Ships transport migrants or tourists across the galaxy. They pick up passengers from colonies and transport them either to a new colony (for migration) or to a resort base (for tourism).

Passenger ships are privately owned and go about their business automatically.

[H2]State-Owned Bases[/H2]
[H3]Spaceport[/H3]
Spaceports are bases that provide many important services for your empire. Spaceports must be built at a colony.

They serve as a central point of trade for your empire. Mined resources are brought here by freighters and mining ships.

Spaceports also provide construction facilities for your empire. Both state and private ships are built here. When private citizens purchase freighters or other ships, your empire earns income.

Spaceports also provide other vital functions:
[ULI]Heavy weapons provide strong defense for the colony[/ULI]
[ULI]Research facilities for your scientists and engineers[/ULI]
[ULI]Bonuses that help keep the colony population happy: medical facilities and recreation centres[/ULI]

You should typically have a spaceport in most systems where you have colonies. Resources collected by mining ships, as well as excess resources at mining stations, are brought to your nearest spaceport. Thus having spaceports strategically spread throughout your empire decreases travel time for your freighters and improves efficiency.

To cycle through all of your Spaceports use the Y key, or Shift-Y to cycle backwards.

[H3]Research Station[/H3]
Research stations provide dedicated research facilities that unlock new technology for use by your empire.

They are usually built at special locations that provide research bonuses in a specific area. These research bonus locations are discovered through exploration.

[H3]Resort Base[/H3]
Resort Bases are specialized state-owned bases built at scenic locations throughout the galaxy. These are favored vacation destinations for tourists.

Construction Ships build Resort Bases at any location deemed scenic enough. These locations could be ringed planets, black holes, neutron stars, or planets with unusual ruins or ancient monuments.

Passenger Ships transport tourists from wealthy colonies to Resort Bases. As tourists arrive at the resort, the empire that owns the resort earns income. Tourists will only choose to visit resorts where the scenery is sufficiently appealing. They also don’t like to travel too far. So build your resort bases at the most scenic locations that are reasonably close to large, wealthy colonies.

Resort Bases are typically lightly armed and defended, with enough firepower to fend off any marauding pirates or stray space creatures.

[H3]Defensive Base[/H3]
Defensive Bases are stationed in orbit around important colonies, providing powerful defense from any attackers.

They have a wide array of weapons and are strongly shielded and armored. They may also support star fighters for further defensive power.

You may build multiple defensive bases at a single colony, turning it into a virtual fortress.

[H3]Monitoring Station[/H3]
Monitoring Stations are bases that include long range scanner components for monitoring a wide area.

They can be used to spy on other empires systems, or to give you better visibility of enemy movements towards your territory.

These bases are typically built in quiet systems that provide visibility of an enemy location.

[H2]Civilian Bases[/H2]
[H3]Mining Station[/H3]
Mining Stations are fixed mining platforms built at resource-rich planets and moons. These stations extract resources at their location.

Freighters pick up extracted resources from mining stations, transporting their cargo to the appropriate destination.

Mining Stations are built by Construction Ships at resource-rich planets. Because they are purpose-built for their location, mining stations extract resources much faster than mobile mining ships.

Mining Stations should usually be patrolled by military ships to defend against pirate raids or aggressive space creatures.

Once the first mining station has been built at a planet or moon no others can be built there. However, if the planet or moon is subsequently colonized then the mining station will be removed. Colonies extract resources by themselves, without the need for mining stations or mining ships.
