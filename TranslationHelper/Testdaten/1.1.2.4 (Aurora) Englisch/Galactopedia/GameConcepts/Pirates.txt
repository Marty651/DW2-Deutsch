Pirates can be dangerous threats, causing chaos and destruction as they raid and attack your bases and colonies.

Pirates have a focus on survival in the harsh frontiers of space.

[H3]Pirate Bases and ships[/H3]
Pirates are entirely space-based factions - they have no colonies. Instead they use a spaceport as their home base. This pirate base is typically found at a fuel source, like a Gas Giant planet. A pirate faction is destroyed when it loses it's pirate base.

They also have a collection of small military ships that they use to raid and attack. As they successfully raid they can increase their forces with further ships.

[H3]Where did they come from?[/H3]
Most civilizations in the galaxy are primitive, struggling to return to the stars. So where did pirates come from? What is their history? Why are they space-faring but planetary civilizations are not?

These questions are worthy topics to explore. Whatever the case, pirates certainly have much knowledge of the galaxy that they may be willing to share - for a price, and only if they like you enough.

So it may be worth your while to improve relations with pirates, at least with some of them.

[H3]Diplomacy with Pirates[/H3]
Pirates will typically attack without mercy. However they may offer you a Protection agreement. This means that for a monthly fee they agree not to attack you.

If you manage to improve relations enough, they may also offer to sell you secret information. Pirates have good maps of the galaxy. They may also know other factions that they can put you in touch with. Any they often know about a few important secrets or special locations.

As your military forces get stronger, the diplomatic equation with pirates changes. They will begin to fear you more and thus may avoid attacking you.

If you get knowledge of their pirate base location, they will also be more cautious with you, knowing that they may now be at risk.
