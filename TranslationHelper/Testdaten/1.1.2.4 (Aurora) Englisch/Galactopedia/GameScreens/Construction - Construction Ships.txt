Construction Ships are mobile construction yards. They build bases of various types: mining stations, research stations, resort bases, monitoring stations. They can also repair immobile damaged ships. They can even repair abandoned ships and bases encountered through exploration.

Building a new base requires construction resources. So the first action a Construction Ships takes when assigned a construction mission is to travel to the nearest spaceport to load the required construction resources.

[H3]Construction Ship List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the Construction Ships in your empire.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the Construction Ships are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the current mission of the Construction Ship.

[H3]Automation Status[/H3]
The small button at the right allows you to change the automation status of the ship. Thus you can manually control the construction ship or fully automate it, allowing it to select it's own missions.

Or you can have more specific automation, where the construction ship will only build mining stations, research stations, monitoring stations, resort bases or salvage abandoned ships and bases.
