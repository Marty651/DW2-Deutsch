Diplomacy involves monitoring the relationships between many different empires, especially how they feel about you. Making friends with the right empires - and avoiding the wrath of the wrong ones - can be a tricky business.

Empires are constantly evaluating their relationships with other empires. Their evaluations are influenced positively or negatively by the following factors.

[H3]Trade Volume[/H3]
Having a high trade volume between two empires enhances a diplomatic relationship. You have no direct control over trade - this is carried out by your private citizens.

[H3]Racial affinity[/H3]
Each alien race has biases that make other races natural friends or rivals.

[H3]Government affinity[/H3]
Each form of government has natural friends and rivals - other government types that they like or dislike. Most empires gravitate towards other empires with forms of government similar to themselves.

[H3]Treaties[/H3]
Forming a treaty with another empire is an expression of trust. This improves relations between the two empires.

[H3]Gifts[/H3]
Sending gifts to other empires makes them like you more. The bigger the gift, the greater the impact on your relationship.

However you should not send gifts too often. Leave at least a year between gifts for maximum impact.

[H3]Relationship with friends[/H3]
Your friends are the empires that you have treaties with. If an empire is at war with one of your friends then this will affect your relationship negatively. Alternatively if an empire has a treaty with one of your friends then this will affect your relationship positively.

[H3]Relationship with enemies[/H3]
Your enemies are the empires that you are at war with, or have poor relations with. If an empire has treaties with one of your enemies then this will affect your relationship negatively.

[H3]Competition for systems or resources[/H3]
You cannot normally colonize in a system owned by another empire. But you can colonize independent colonies in other empire's systems.

Having a colony in a system already settled by another empire is always considered very bad form. The other empire will take great offense at such an action.

Likewise building mining stations or other bases in a system that has been colonized by another empire will also cause offense, though much less than colonizing a planet.

[H3]Attacks against us by other empire[/H3]
When empires desire resources or colonies of your empire they may test your defenses with bold raids. Of course most empires take a very dim view of unprovoked attacks.

[H3]Intercepted intelligence missions[/H3]
When an intelligence mission against another empire is detected or intercepted then the diplomatic fallout can be very high. Other empires strongly dislike you carrying out intelligence missions against them.

[H3]Empire Reputation[/H3]
Your empire’s reputation will affect other empires evaluations of you. See “Empire Reputation” for more details.

[H3]Blockades[/H3]
Blockading a colony or base of another empire is a sure way to cause great offense to them. Each further blockade you initiate only adds to the insult. Keep it up and you’ll be at war in no time.
