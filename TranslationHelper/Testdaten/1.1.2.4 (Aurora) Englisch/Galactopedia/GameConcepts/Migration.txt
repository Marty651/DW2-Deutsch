Migration generally involves people migrating from large colonies to new, smaller colonies. Migration helps quickly boost the population of new colonies, enabling them to become productive faster.

Migrants are transported to their destination by privately-owned passenger ships. Migration occurs entirely in the private sector of your empire – you have no direct control over the movement of citizens between your colonies.

[H3]Migration Factors[/H3]
Factors that attract new migrants to a colony include:
[ULI]low tax rates[/ULI]
[ULI]general desirability: high planet quality, high development levels[/ULI]
[ULI]how close the new colony is to the migrant’s current home colony[/ULI]

Factors that promote emigration away from a colony include:
[ULI]happiness level at colony: unhappiness promotes emigration[/ULI]
[ULI]high population: heavily populated colonies promote emigration[/ULI]
[ULI]nearby colonies desirable for emigration[/ULI]

[H3]Inter-empire Migration[/H3]
People are more likely to migrate within their own empire, simply because it's easier - there’s less bureacracy to overcome.

However if you have a Migration treaty with another empire then inter-empire migration can also occur.

Once your empire contains one billion citizens of a specific alien race, your empire will also receive their racial bonuses. This might include smarter scientists and engineers, better spies, faster miners, etc.

[H3]Colony Population Policies[/H3]
Population Policies provide control over which alien races you allow at your colonies.

These can be set in the Population Policy screen which pops out from the Selection Panel when one of your colonies is selected. Hover over the population policy icon at the far-right of the population row for the selected colony. Click the icon or the screen to lock it open.

Each race you have met is listed, allowing you to set specific policies for every alien race at each colony.

Using these settings gives you precise control over migration to your colonies.
