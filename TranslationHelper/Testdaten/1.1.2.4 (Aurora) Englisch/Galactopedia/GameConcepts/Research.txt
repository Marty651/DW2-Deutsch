Research opens up new technologies for use in constructing ships and bases. It can also provide your empire with new capabilities, like colonizing new types of planets or building new planetary facilities.

To obtain these new technologies and capabilities you must carry out research in specific projects that unlock these new breakthroughs.

Researching projects takes time. The speed of research is determined by the research output from your colonies and research stations.

Below is a list of benefits that can be obtained from research:
[ULI]new Ship Hulls allowing you to build new types of ships or bases[/ULI]
[ULI]completely new components that can be built into your ships and bases, giving them new capabilities[/ULI]
[ULI]improvements to existing components: your ships and bases that use these improved components are automatically and immediately upgraded with enhanced capabilities. This reduces the need to retrofit your ships and bases to benefit from research breakthroughs[/ULI]
[ULI]new planetary facilities that can be built at your colonies[/ULI]
[ULI]the ability to colonize new types of planets[/ULI]
[ULI]improved abilities for troop units[/ULI]
[ULI]bonuses to your empire in various areas[/ULI]
[ULI]improvements to diplomacy with specific alien races[/ULI]

[H2]Research Screen[/H2]
You can view the currently available research projects in the Research screen (F10).

The left side of the screen has projects for the lowest tech levels. These are the techs that you have at the start of a new game.

As you progress towards the right of the screen, the tech level increases.

Hovering over a project will provide details on the new technology and other benefits that it provides.

[H3]Order of Research[/H3]
Projects are linked together by paths. Parent projects must be researched before child projects. As you research one project, any child projects (usually to the right) are enabled for research.

[H3]Blind versus Non-Blind Research[/H3]
When your game has been setup to use blind research then you can only see the next available projects beyond those already researched.

When your game has been setup to see all research then you can see all of the projects from the start of the game.

[H3]Queuing Projects to be Researched[/H3]
Left-click a project to queue it up for research. You can queue up to 15 projects.

When you have multiple research stations you can research more than one project at a time. You can set the upper limit of concurrent projects in the Research section of the Empire Policy screen (P key).

Each project will begin researching immediately after its preceding project(s) are completed.

[H3]Race-specific tech[/H3]
Some research projects are limited to specific alien races - these cannot be researched by anyone else.

However these techs can sometimes be obtained through other means. For example you might be able to trade this tech with a race that has it.

Note though that if you obtain a tech through trade, you cannot then trade it away to another empire - you do not understand the tech well enough to explain it to someone else.

[H3]Initiation Costs[/H3]
Some projects require an initiation cost to be paid before research can begin. The cost may include money and resources.

When you left-click to queue a project that has initiation costs, a prompt window will popup asking you to approve payment of the costs.

[H3]Extra Requirements[/H3]
Some projects have extra research bonus requirements before you can begin researching them. This means that they can only be initiated when you have sufficient research bonuses of a particular type, e.g. some high-end Shield projects require you to have a certain threshold of Shield research bonuses.

You can obtain research bonuses in specific areas by seeking out these locations through exploration. When you find an area with special research bonuses you can then build a research station there to obtain those bonuses for your empire.

[H3]Crash Research[/H3]
You can accelerate research of an important project by 'crash-researching' it. This means spending money to double the research rate for that project.

To begin a crash research program, click the top-most project currently being researched (i.e. the first project in the queue). A prompt will indicate the cost of the crash program and ask you to confirm the spending. Research projects being crash-researched are indicated by a stopwatch icon at upper-left of the project.

[H2]Research Sources and Output[/H2]
Research output comes from both the populations at your colonies and research stations that you build.

To fully exploit your research output you should also spend excess funding on research. Fully-funded research means faster access to new technologies.

You can allocate research funding in the Funding Levels screen (shift-F2) in the Empire section.

[H3]Research Stations[/H3]
Research Stations should be built at locations with research bonuses. These research bonuses come from unusual galactic anomalies, often found at exotic locations like black holes, neutron stars and other places.

The New Research Locations list (shift-F9) shows the best places to build new Research Stations. 

Use the button at the right of each list row to queue construction of a new research station at the location. When the next construction ship becomes available it will build a research station here. You can click the button again to cancel construction.

Once a research station is built at a location, the research bonuses there get included in your empire's overall research bonuses. 

Research bonuses are important in two ways:
[ULI]research speed is increased for projects with the matching bonus type, e.g. researching new Ship Hulls is accelerated when you have construction research bonuses[/ULI]
[ULI]as explained above, some research projects have extra requirements where they can only be initiated when you have sufficient research bonuses of a particular type, e.g. some high-end Shield projects require you to have a certain threshold of Shield research bonuses[/ULI]
