The Policy Settings screen allows you to control which parts of your empire are automated, which areas you want advisors to guide you with, and which areas you want to completely control for yourself.

You can expand or collapse each section by clicking on the header bars. In addition to the high-level automation controls, each area also has many other settings that allow you to adjust things in more detail. Hover over each setting for an explanation.

The top section 'Advisors and Automation' summarizes all of the automation settings for your empire, providing a single centralized location to change which areas are automated, advisor-controlled or manually controlled. You can even select one of the preset configurations from the dropdown list at the top.
