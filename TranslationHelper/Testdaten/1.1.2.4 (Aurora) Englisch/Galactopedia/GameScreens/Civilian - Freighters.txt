This screen lists all of the freighters in your empire.

Freighters are part of your civilian economy, so you cannot assign missions to them. Instead they seek out their own missions, transporting cargo between locations.

Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. You can filter by the type of resources being transported: fuel, construction or luxury resources.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the freighters are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows the ship's current mission. It also shows any cargo that the ship is carrying.
