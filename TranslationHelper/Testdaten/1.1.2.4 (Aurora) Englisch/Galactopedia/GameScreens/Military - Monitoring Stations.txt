Monitoring Stations are specialized bases that provide long range scanners to monitor strategic locations. They are built at quiet locations that are within range to monitor enemy targets.

[H3]Monitoring Station List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the current monitoring stations in your empire. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the monitoring stations are highlighted on the map. System and Location badges also indicate spaceports using the yellow construction icon. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it's location. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.
