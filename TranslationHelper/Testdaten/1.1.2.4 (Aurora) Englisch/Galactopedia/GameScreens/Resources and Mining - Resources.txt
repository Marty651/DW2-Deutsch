Resources are the raw materials found at planets, moons and asteroids. These can include metallic ores, gases, minerals, textiles, foods, beverages, and many other items.

You can mine these resources, extracting them for use in your empire.

Some resources are used in constructing new ships and bases. Other resources are used to raise the development of your colonies - these are luxury resources. And one resource (Caslon) is used as a universal reactor fuel.

[H3]Resources List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the resources in the galaxy.

By default the resources are filtered to show only the fuel and construction resources that your empire is currently using. The default sort order prioritizes resources where your empire has a production shortage.

Check the sort and filter settings at the top of the panel for more options. Other filter options include showing luxury resources that add to the development of your colonies. Sort options include mining rates, demand, number of sources, and stockpile levels in your empire.

[H3]Resource Flow Map Overlay[/H3]
When the Resources list is open, the Resource Flow galaxy map overlay is auto-enabled, showing the flow of resources between star systems in your empire. This helps you to visualize the flow of cargo being moved by freighters and mining ships between the colonies and bases in your empire.

Clicking on a single resource in the list filters the Resource Flow map overlay to only show the cargo transport for the selected resource. All known source locations for the selected resource are also highlighted on the galaxy map. Clicking the resource again deselects it.

Each list item shows the current stockpile, production rate and number of known and exploited sources for the resource.
