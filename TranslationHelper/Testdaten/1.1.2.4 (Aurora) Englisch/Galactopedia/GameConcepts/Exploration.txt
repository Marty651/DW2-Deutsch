At the start of the game the galaxy is unknown. You only have reliable information about your homeworld.

[H3]Exploration Ships and missions[/H3]
Exploration involves sending out exploration ships to visit unknown worlds, revealing their resources, colonization suitability, and any special bonuses. They may also encounter ancient ruins or abandoned ships or bases that can be investigated.

At each location the exploration ship sends out survey teams to inspect the planet, moon, asteroid or star. Surveying is slow and time-consuming.

Higher tech levels unlock exploration scanner components that allow faster exploration. However slower survey teams can still be useful to explore a location more thoroughly and thus uncover deeply hidden items.

You can manually assign exploration missions to your exploration ships, or you can automate them so that they seek out unexplored areas on their own.

Multiple exploration ships in the same empire will spread out and explore a different area of the galaxy or star system.

[H3]Ongoing Exploration[/H3]
While some items are easily discovered by a quick survey or scan of a location, other items are more deeply hidden and require deeper exploration to uncover.

An exploration ship may detect a hidden item, but not be able to see what it is. Further surveying of the area may uncover the item. But deeply hidden items may require higher tech survey or scan components before they can be found.

Colonies and bases will automatically explore their location, progressively revealing any deeply hidden items there.

[H3]System Visibility[/H3]
Before your empire first visits a star system, it is unexplored. You cannot see any planets or moons in the system.

When you visit the system for the first time it then becomes explored – you can then have knowledge of the planets and moons in the system, and thus can always see them along with their basic information.

When your empire has a ship, base or colony present in a system, then more items in the system are visible to you. This can include the ships and bases of other empires, as well as space creatures.

But when you have no presence in a system, you cannot see any ships or bases of other empires in the system.

[H3]Partial Visibility[/H3]
Some items may be only partially visible: you can see that something is there, but not what it is.

The visibility of an item depends on having short- or long-range scanners within range that can see it.

So even when you have a direct presence in a system (ship, base or colony), that does not mean that you have perfect visibility of every location in the system.

This can be further complicated by other factors that further reduce the visibility of a ship or base, as outlined below:

[H3]Size[/H3]
Smaller ships or bases are harder to detect or identify. Larger ships and bases are easier to detect and identify.

[H3]Nebula interference[/H3]
Nebula clouds signiifcantly interfere with scanners, greatly reducing effective scan range. This means that ships and bases inside nebula clouds are much harder to see or identify.

[H3]Empire Masking[/H3]
Reduces the visibility of the empire of the ship or base. The ship may be seen, but the empire may be unknown.

[H3]Role Masking[/H3]
Reduces visibility of the type of ship or base. The ship may be seen, but it's role appears as a generic freighter.

[H3]Stealth[/H3]
Stealth reduces overall visibility, making it harder to see a ship or base at all. Or if it is seen, it may just appear as a generic independent freighter.
