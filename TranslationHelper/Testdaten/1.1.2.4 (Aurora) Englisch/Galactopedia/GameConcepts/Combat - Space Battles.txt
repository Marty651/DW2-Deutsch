The tactical settings of ships and fleets determine how they will engage enemy ships. This includes if and when ships or fleets choose to engage an enemy target. See the topic 'Tactical Settings' for more details.

Space battles between ships occur whenever enemy forces come within range of your weapons.

Ideally your ship should have weapons with a longer range than your opponent. You then maneuver to stay outside the weapons range of your opponent while firing your longer range weapons at them.

In practice many other factors also come in to play:
[ULI]your opponent may have longer range weapons than you which requires you to close in and fire all your weapons at them[/ULI]
[ULI]the speed and agility of your opponent may make it impossible to maneuver into the ideal firing position[/ULI]
[ULI]your opponent may have heavy shielding and armor that requires an attack at point blank range[/ULI]

For example this could mean that heavily armed ships may be better to close to point-blank range and shower their opponents with withering broadsides of fire, even if this temporarily exposes them to their opponent’s weapons.

[H3]Initiating an attack[/H3]
To initiate an attack on an enemy ship, first select one of your military ships and then right-click the enemy ship. Holding down the right mouse button will display a popup menu with any other mission types valid for this attacker and target.

You have little direct control over your ships when they are engaged in combat – they simply follow the battle tactics you have selected for the ships design. In the heat of battle it is up to the ship’s captain to apply these tactics as best they can.

Various types of weapons and other components can be fitted to your ships to improve their performance in combat. These can include the following:

[H3]Defensive Technologies[/H3]
[ULI]Shields: protect your ships from incoming weapons fire. Shields are reduced when weapons impact them. Some enemy weapons fire may leak through shields, damaging armor or other components. This is especially true when the Shield components have a high Shield Penetration rating. Shields regenerate themselves over time, but not fast enough to offset weapon impacts when in combat[/ULI]
[ULI]Area Shield Recharge: allow a ship or base to restore the shield levels of nearby friendly ships when their shields drop below 50%[/ULI]
[ULI]Armor: the last line of defense to protect your ships from incoming weapons fire. When shields are penetrated, armor absorbs enemy weapon damage. Armor may completely absorb low intensity weapons fire, suffering no damage. However higher energy weapons will completely destroy armor, leaving your ship completely exposed to further weapon strikes[/ULI]
[ULI]Countermeasures: throw off incoming weapons fire, making it less likely to strike your ship[/ULI]
[ULI]Fleet Countermeasures: provide improved countermeasures capability to all nearby ships in the fleet[/ULI]
[ULI]Intercept Weapons: close-in weapons system that fire deadly bursts at nearby enemy weapons or fighters, disabling or destroying them. Many intercept weapons can also be used to attack enemy targets, though they may be more specialized at defense[/ULI]
[ULI]Ion Defense: protect a ship or base against the disabling effects of Ion weapons[/ULI]
[ULI]Damage Control: reduce the amount of damage caused to a ship by enemy weapons fire. Some damage control components also provide a repair function, enabling your ships to quickly perform basic repairs even while in combat[/ULI]
[ULI]Tractor Beams: can be used to push away attackers when escaping[/ULI]
[ULI]Assault Pods: provide defensive forces to battle enemy boarding parties attempting to capture your ship or base[/ULI]

[H3]Attack Technologies[/H3]
[ULI]Direct-Fire weapons: includes laser blasters, rail guns and others. Direct-Fire weapons have limited ability to maneuver or change course once fired. Direct-Fire weapons often have a shorter range, but with a high rate of fire and higher speed, can cause much damage[/ULI]
[ULI]Seeking: includes missiles and torpedoes. Seeking weapons home in, maneuvering to hit their target. Seeking weapons often have long range which enables standoff attacks against well-defended targets like spaceports. However they may be quite slow, making them less effective against fast, agile ships[/ULI]
[ULI]Full Length Beam: includes many types of weapons. Full Length Beams fire a continuous energy beam that stretches from the firer to the target. They can have many different ranges: some are short-range, others are longer[/ULI]
[ULI]Bombard weapons: exterminate the population and troops at an enemy colony, and also damage the planet itself, lowering its quality. Some Bombard weapons have more specific targeting, preferentially damaging population, colony development level, planet quality, troops or planetary facilities[/ULI]
[ULI]Ion weapons: fire blasts of ionized particles at enemy targets, temporarily disabling various types of components. Some Ion weapons have more specific targeting, preferentially disabling some components more than others: weapons, engines, hyperdrives, sensors and shields[/ULI]
[ULI]Area weapons: fires a ball of energy to a point in space near an enemy and then initiates a blast that sends out an omni-directional, destructive energy wave outwards from that point. These weapons are usually very powerful, but have a short range and consume large amounts of energy. Area weapons cannot be aimed; they damage anything within range, including your own forces. Thus they should be used with care[/ULI]
[ULI]HyperDeny weapons: prevent any ships within range from initiating a hyperjump. This can be useful to prevent enemy forces from escaping an area of battle. Note that these weapons affect all ships, including your own. HyperDeny weapons are automatically engaged whenever a ship enters combat. Opposing forces can defeat HyperDeny weapons if their HyperDrive has higher HyperBlocking insulation than the strength of the HyperDeny weapon[/ULI]
[ULI]Fighters: fighters and bombers are small one-person spacecraft that are carried aboard a larger military ship or base. They are fast and nimble and can attack a target while the carrier maintains a safe distance. Fighter losses are rebuilt at the Fighter Bay hangars aboard the carrier[/ULI]
[ULI]Combat Targeting sensors: increases the likelihood of your weapons striking their targets[/ULI]
[ULI]Fleet Targetting: increases the targeting accuracy of all nearby ships in the fleet[/ULI]
[ULI]Tractor Beams: can be used to pull enemy targets closer[/ULI]
[ULI]Assault Pods: used to launch boarding parties against an enemy ship or base in an attempt to capture it. The enemy ship must be within boarding range and have its shields sufficiently lowered[/ULI]

Other factors which influence combat are:
[ULI]Ship handling agility: more maneuverable ships allow better positioning so that you can avoid your opponents weapons but fire your weapons at them. To increase agility add more vectoring engines to your ships. Also minimize your ship size[/ULI]
[ULI]Ship speed: faster ships can escape attackers or overtake targets[/ULI]
[ULI]Scanner components: enable you to track enemy ships from a distance. If an enemy escapes by hyperjumping into deep space, your scanner may sometimes track the hyperjump and allow you to continue pursuing your target. This ability is determined by the Jump Tracking value of the scanner component[/ULI]

[H3]Weapon Accuracy[/H3]
When weapons are fired at a target their accuracy is determined by the following factors:
[ULI]Distance from the target: if the weapon is near the limit of its range then it will be less accurate than if it is close to the target[/ULI]
[ULI]Speed of the target: slower targets are easier to hit. Completely stationary targets like bases are especially easy to hit[/ULI]
[ULI]Combat Targeting sensors on your ships increase the likelihood that your weapons will find their target[/ULI]
[ULI]Countermeasures components on your ships make them harder to hit[/ULI]
[ULI]Random, uncontrollable factors also play their part in making weapons accuracy better or worse[/ULI]
