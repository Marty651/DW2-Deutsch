Defensive Bases are heavy weapons platforms that are used to defend important colonies. They are built in space around the colony and provide substantial firepower to combat attacking enemy forces.

[H3]Defensive Base List[/H3]
This screen lists all of the current Defensive Bases in your empire. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the defensive bases are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it's location. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.
