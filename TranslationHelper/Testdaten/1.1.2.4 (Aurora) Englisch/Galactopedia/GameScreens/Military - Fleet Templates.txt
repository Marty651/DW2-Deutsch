Fleet Templates allow you to define the composition of your fleets, setting the amount of ships for each ship role. They also define a grouping of default tactical settings. You can then create new fleets based on a template.

Fleets will attempt to include ships that match the roles and amounts outlined in their template. But if there are insufficient ships available for a desired role, the fleet will fall-back to using ships from other roles to fill out the overall number of ships.

Each fleet role has a default template: Attack, Raid, Defend, Invade. You can also manually create other templates for each fleet role.

[H3]Creating Fleets using Fleet Templates[/H3]
You can create new fleets by manually selecting ships and then forming a fleet with them. However the Fleet Templates screen provides a couple of quick ways of creating new fleets.

In the Fleet Templates screen you can select the desired template and then click either the 'Form new fleet' or 'Build new fleet' buttons at the right.
