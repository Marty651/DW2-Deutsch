    <Name>Entwicklungsdrohne des Alten Wächters</Name>
    <Description>A drone designed to help reestablish colonies destroyed by the Shakturi during the war. It speeds construction of infrastructure and economic centers, thus helping the colony thrive at an accelerated pace. The drone actively resists all efforts to analyze its technology. Its designers went to great lengths to make certain it could not be replicated.</Description>

    <Name>Weltverbesserungsplan X-1084-W</Name>
    <Description>A data crystal containing information designed to facilitate both basic colony development and the development and maintenance of advanced facilities. Composed during the Shakturi war, it seems to anticipate a time when the galaxy would need to rebuild following a complete collapse of civilization. Even so, the text focuses on practical procedures and is entirely devoid of sentiment.</Description>

    <Description>What rational being can fathom an item of Shakturi design? It contains no elements of technology as we understand it. It is only a tangle of intersecting crystals, and yet this device will allow us to enhance sensor readings throughout our empire. What else could the Shakturi do? </Description>

    <Name>Geheimnisse der Baumeister</Name>
    <Description>Machine minds do not think in ways organic beings can understand. The decision of the Ancient Guardians to construct knowledge-preserving Vaults was made over an impossibly long period of time. It also happened in the blink of an eye. Do not try and fathom how both of these things can be true. You must merely accept that it is so.

Once Ancient Guardians understood the importance of preserving galactic knowledge, they began to construct Vaults at a speed unimaginable for organic beings. Many of their techniques are applicable only to machine intelligences, but a small portion of their wisdom can be passed along to biological creatures to aid in their own construction efforts.</Description>
