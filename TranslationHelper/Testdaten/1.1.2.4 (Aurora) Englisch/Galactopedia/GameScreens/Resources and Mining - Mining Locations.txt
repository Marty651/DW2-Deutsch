This screen lists all of the current mining locations in your empire. This includes colonies and mining stations. Check the sort and filter options at the top of the panel. You can filter by individual resources to quickly identify all of the locations for a particular resource in your empire.

When zoomed out to the galaxy- or system-level the mining locations are highlighted on the map. Hovering over an item in the list will ping the location on the map. Clicking the item will select it's location. Double-clicking the item will move the view to that location.

Each list item shows all of the known resources being mined at that location, along with their abundances. If a resource has a production shortage it's image is surrounded by a dashed red border. Hover over each resource for more details, including any bonuses it provides.
